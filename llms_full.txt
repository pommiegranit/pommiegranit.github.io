# Australian Government Style Manual

Source: https://www.stylemanual.gov.au

> The Style Manual is for everyone who writes, edits or approves Australian Government content. Use it to create clear and consistent content that meets the needs of users.


## Agency responsibilities and commitments

Accessibility is a mandatory standard for government agencies. Test your content
against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) success criteria.
Agencies should commit to improving their performance against the standard.

### Use WCAG to guide your agency about accessibility

‘WCAG’ stands for [Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). WCAG 2.2 is the
current version. The Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) released version 2.2 in
October 2023.

WCAG is a stable standard to meet specific needs of people with disability. The
standard acknowledges its limitations in meeting needs for people with cognitive
and learning disabilities.

The standard is integrated with Style Manual guidance to help you create
inclusive content.

### Meet WCAG level AA, but aim higher

Accessibility is a mandatory government standard. WCAG is a baseline
accessibility standard for Australian Government content.

Test your content against the WCAG success criteria. You need to meet the level
A criteria to meet level AA.

Your agency will need to make its own assessment about whether content achieves
a WCAG level AA standard. You'll find the WCAG success criteria that relate to
any given Style Manual topic on the relevant page.

Not all level AA success criteria are covered in the Style Manual. You will need
to refer to WCAG to check if there are more criteria to consider for a specific
piece of content.

Aiming higher than the level AA standard will improve usability.

The Style Manual relates the level AAA standard to some topics. This promotes
the aim that government content meets the highest WCAG standard whenever
possible.

### Include an accessibility statement

An accessibility statement gives users:

* information about how you’ve addressed WCAG
* information about the technical specifications you’ve tested
* evidence of a commitment to accessibility.

For example, your statement might mention how your agency is working on its
implementation of the standard.

Include a page on your site that explains the extent your service or product
complies with WCAG.

You can check how the Style Manual measures up to level AA in its [accessibility
statement](/node/12).

### Other accessibility guidance and standards

W3C has a working draft of recommendations that will expand on WCAG: [Making
content usable for people with cognitive and learning
disabilities](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/).

You may also need to refer to [other relevant
W3C standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/).

For procurements, check [Accessibility requirements suitable for public
procurement of ICT products and
services](https://infostore.saiglobal.com/en-au/standards/as-en-301-549-2016-100620_saig_as_as_211428/) (AS
EN 301 549:2016). Refer to the digital sourcing [Consider First
policy](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/ict-procurement/digital-sourcing-framework-ict-procurement/digital-sourcing-policies/digital-sourcing-consider-first-policy),
which applies to non-corporate Commonwealth entities.

#### Legal and policy frameworks

Accessibility is integral to Australian Government policy for digital
transformation, and written into the [Digital Service
Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/about-digital-service-standard).

##### Legal requirement

Failure to provide equal access to government services (including information)
can be a failure of obligation under the [Disability Discrimination Act
1992](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04426).

Australia has obligations under international frameworks, including:

* the United Nations [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/showDetails.aspx?objid=080000028017bf87&clang=_en)
* the World Intellectual Property Organization [Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled](https://wipolex.wipo.int/en/treaties/textdetails/13169) (Marrakesh Treaty).

These international frameworks are relevant to Australia’s domestic policy
settings through the [National Disability
Strategy](https://www.disabilitygateway.gov.au/ads).

## Apply accessibility principles

User needs are at the heart of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
When you take user needs into account, applying accessibility principles becomes
simpler, though not necessarily easier.

### Use WCAG principles to meet user needs

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 guidelines can be expressed
as user needs. These needs feature throughout the Style Manual. The following
lists group user needs (guidelines) under WCAG principles.

#### Principle: content is perceivable

Any user can perceive the content.

**User needs**:

* I can understand any information contained in an image. ([Guideline: text alternatives](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/##text-alternatives))
* I can access equivalent information to anything contained in a video or audio file. ([Guideline: time-based media](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/##time-based-media))
* I can change the content’s presentation without losing information or structure. ([Guideline: adaptable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/##adaptable))
* I can easily control how I see and hear distinctions if colour or sound convey meaning. ([Guideline: distinguishable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/##distinguishable))

#### Principle: content is operable

Any user can operate the navigation and interface.

**User needs**:

* I can operate the content using only a keyboard. ([Guideline: keyboard accessible](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/##keyboard-accessible))
* I can control any features that involve timing so I have enough time to read and use the content. ([Guideline: enough time](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/##enough-time))
* I can use the content without experiencing a seizure or physical reaction. ([Guideline: seizures and physical reactions](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/##seizures-and-physical-reactions))
* I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage. ([Guideline: navigable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/##navigable))
* I can operate the webpage with something other than a keyboard, like a pointer. ([Guideline: input modalities](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/##input-modalities))

#### Principle: content is understandable

Any user can understand the information and the interface.

**User needs**:

* I can read and understand text, even if the content includes unusual words and shortened forms,or features languages other than English. ([Guideline: readable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/##readable))
* I can predict the webpage’s appearance and how I will operate the content. ([Guideline: predictable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/##predictable))
* I can avoid making any mistakes with my inputs, and correct any that I might make. ([Guideline: input assistance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/##input-assistance))

#### Principle: content is robust

Assistive technologies can interpret the content.

**User need:** I have confidence the markup language supports my use of software
and assistive technology to access the content. ([Guideline:
compatible](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/##compatible))

### Follow Style Manual guidance on accessibility requirements

Look for accessibility requirements as you check guidance for different topics.

Callout boxes in the Style Manual relate user needs to fundamental actions you
can take to ensure content is accessible by design.

Callouts also include references to WCAG criteria that link to technical
details (level A, level AA and level AAA success criteria).

The Style Manual also includes links to other external resources about
accessibility.

## Design for accessibility and inclusion

How we design has a direct influence on what we design. Inclusive design means
that the products and services we create work for everyone.

### Design for all

The idea of ‘design for all’ has its roots in human-computer interaction
studies. This body of knowledge offers practical methods to improve people’s
experience of digital content.

The Style Manual promotes some of these methods, in line with the [Digital
Service
Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/about-digital-service-standard),
such as:

* [understanding needs through user research](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/1-understand-user-needs)
* [embedding accessibility as a foundation](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/9-make-it-accessible)
* [using consistent and responsive design](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/6-consistent-and-responsive-design).

The goal is inclusive design that meets a diverse range of needs. Inclusive
design considers user experience in a range of situations – for example, on
different devices and for time-poor users.

### Do user research

Find out more about [user research for content](/node/76). This aspect of
inclusive design is core to Style Manual guidance.

As part of your user research, test content to gain:

* input from the users you’re designing for
* views and feedback from a diverse and representative users.

You can make content accessible for one user, but it will benefit others in
different situations.

For example, user research can help you understand:

* a person who uses their mobile and needs simple menu options
* a time-poor executive who needs content that’s easy to scan
* a person who needs to fill in a form, but English is not their first language.

Accessibility is a common thread in each of these situations.

Combine your user research with accessibility techniques to design usable
content.

### Ask what makes content usable

Usability and accessibility are closely linked. People will use content that
accommodates their needs (usable content). They turn away from content that is
alienating or frustrating to use.

Accessible content is a foundation to address broader user needs. For example,
page structure feeds into assistive technology. But good page structure also
improves readability.

You can think of accessibility as a necessary step to create usable content.

Consider a user who cannot perceive images and the content provides no
description, such as [alt text](/node/49). In this situation, visual content is
not usable because it is not accessible.

### Create content for people with diverse abilities

People can experience difficulties with access because of ongoing, temporary and
situational barriers. Government content needs to be designed so it does not
create barriers to access.

<example> 
Using sight to read:

* A senior executive has an inflamed optic nerve that limits their field of vision. They may experience a temporary barrier to access.
* A commuter on public transport cannot read on their phone because the screen reflects their surroundings. They may experience a situational barrier to access.
</example>

Poor design causes people to experience ongoing, temporary or situational
difficulties. This can limit the extent and duration of access to online content
in many ways.

Accessibility is how you can avoid setting up barriers for people with diverse
abilities.

When you design content, it needs to serve people with:

* age-related conditions
* changing abilities
* disability
* health issues
* cognitive, neurological and learning disabilities.

Usable content accommodates this range of human experience.

## How people read

Write and design content that matches how users read. Use short sentences and
simple structure.

### Simple language, structure and design helps all users

To create usable content, take into account how people read and what makes
content easy to read.

You can increase usability with:

* legible page design
* readable language
* comprehensible structure.

People read text in different ways. How they read depends on:

* how well they already understand the subject
* how familiar the vocabulary is.

#### Digital Service Standard requirements

You must understand the needs of all users of your service and create content
they can access to meet the Digital Service Standard:

* [Criterion 1. Understand user needs](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/1-understand-user-needs)
* [Criterion 9. Make it accessible](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/9-make-it-accessible).

### People skim headings and page structure

To help people understand the type of content, use a clear
[structure](/node/75).

People want to find the information they need. They skim over the headings to
find ‘signposts’ that confirm the content is relevant. Before reading the text,
they look at other elements such as:

* headings
* links
* images
* tables
* lists.

Layout and typography are also important. A clear visual structure with an
easy-to-read font is quicker to scan and read.

The way people read content on a screen is different to how they read in print.

On a smaller screen, such as a phone, people are likely to scan the entire
screen before focusing on text or other elements. On other devices, people
usually start at the centre of the screen and scan to the left and to the right.
Structure the page to make the most useful content stand out.

If people are looking for specific information, they are likely to scan the text
as a whole to find what they need. They will look for links, a specific term, a
number or an address. For this reason, present information in an accepted
pattern such as:

* an address block
* underlined hyperlinks.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
* I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.

Fundamentals:

* Write clear page titles. This is the first thing a screen reader user will hear and should align with the first heading on the page.
* Organise content with a clear structure using section headings. Describe the topics or the following section in the heading.
* Make sure users can navigate through all content in the intended order, regardless of the technology they're using. Use the same navigation elements across the service.
* Don’t rely on colour alone to structure pages.
* Don’t rely on sensory characteristics such as shape, size, visual location, orientation or sound to explain things.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [2.4.2 Page titled – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##page-titled)
* [2.4.6 Headings and labels – Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=246##headings-and-labels)
* [2.4.10 Section headings – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##section-headings)
* [1.3.1 Info and relationships – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##info-and-relationships)
* [1.3.2 Meaningful sequence – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##meaningful-sequence)
* [1.3.3 Sensory characteristics – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##sensory-characteristics)

#### Print considerations

People read print content more thoroughly. On a double page of print without any
headings or images, people usually read from top left to bottom right.

When they’re reading non-fiction, people need headings to help them find
information. They also scan illustrations, tables, headings and other elements
before reading the text. Often they do this in a sweeping curve counterclockwise
from the top right before they decide what, if anything, to read.

### Content with too many unfamiliar words slows readers down

Some readers can scan text and quickly find what they need. They don’t focus on
every word. Instead, they take in all the meaning at once. As a result, they
don’t need to read individual words such as ‘the’ to understand a sentence (but
they see all the words).

Other readers have to work harder to understand individual words. They will find
reading easier if you use more familiar words.

Familiar words that are spelled as they sound are easier to read than unfamiliar
words that are not spelled as they sound.

People read more slowly if they find:

* too many unfamiliar words
* too many long words
* unfamiliar or complex sentence structures.

If the content is difficult, people slow down and focus on unfamiliar words.
They might backtrack to try to understand the meaning. This can cause difficulty
with comprehension.

### Complex sentences are hard to read

Complex sentences are harder to read than simple ones.

People pay attention to content only for as long as they need to. They are not
likely to read everything.

People will take seconds to decide from the page title and first few headings if
the content is relevant.

Once people are on a page, they might scan only a fifth of the content before
deciding whether to read in detail.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

I can read and understand text, even if the content includes unusual words,
shortened forms, or features languages other than English.

Fundamentals:

* Write in plain language. This helps all users and is essential for some.
* Level AAA requires a lower secondary education reading level, after removal of proper names and titles (year 7 or between 12 and 14 years old).
* Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases, idioms and so on. Expand all acronyms on their first use.
* Avoid using double negatives

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [3.1.5 Reading level – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##reading-level)
* [3.1.3 Unusual words – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##unusual-words)
* [3.1.4 Abbreviations – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##abbreviations)

### Rhythm changes can help or hinder reading

People need to be able to read as smoothly and quickly as possible. They build a
rhythm as they read a line of text. They automatically go to the beginning of
the next line and begin reading.

Help people build reading rhythm with:

* short sentences
* new [paragraphs](/node/53)
* line breaks.

Varying rhythm can help or hinder comprehension.

#### Sentence length

Short sentences are easier to read because they limit the scope of an idea. But
most readers like the variety and rhythm of a mixture of sentence lengths. For
most readers, aim for an average sentence length of 15 words per sentence. Long
sentences should have no more than 25 words.

<example>
Short sentences are great. But not always. Vary sentence length. It helps people
stay engaged.</example>

#### Paragraphs and line breaks

Paragraphs give people a rest before launching into a new idea. They also help
people quickly find an idea in the writing.

Line breaks also package information. Used well, they are an effective way to
keep people focused and interested.

Line breaks are used to:

* help people focus on one idea at a time
* draw attention to a point – this is why a paragraph of one short sentence can be so effective.

Line breaks disrupt the eye as it moves along a line. Poorly used line breaks
either:

* break ideas in the wrong place – for example, by creating too many short lines
* let ideas run together – for example, by creating long lines.

#### Variations in rhythm

Variations need to support comprehension. For example, you can use a change of
rhythm for emphasis: to make a point or draw the reader's attention to a certain
word.

You can vary rhythm using:

* headings, lists and other elements that give [structure](/node/75)
* [punctuation marks](/node/119)
* parenthetical information – set off using [brackets](/node/111), [commas](/node/109) or [dashes](/node/199).

Each of these variations can interrupt a reading rhythm.

Reading rhythm is also interrupted by:

* unfamiliar words
* [capital letters](/node/116)
* changes in font or typeface, such as [italics](/node/187)
* [images](/node/46).

Any variation or interruption in rhythm can affect comprehension.

<example>
BLOCKS OF CAPITAL LETTERS ARE HARD TO READ.

Use capital letters appropriately to help people understand written English.</example>

## Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples

Use culturally appropriate and respectful language when writing with, for or
about First Nations people.

### There is no single Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander identity

First Nations people are often called Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
peoples. But there is significant diversity within these 2 groups.

There is a wide range of nations, cultures and languages across mainland
Australia and throughout the Torres Strait. Given this diversity, respectful
language use depends on what different communities find appropriate.

‘Aboriginal’ is a broad term that groups nations and custodians of mainland
Australia and most of the islands, including Tasmania, K’gari, Palm Island,
Mornington Island, Groote Eylandt, Bathurst and Melville Islands.

‘Torres Strait Islander’ is a broad term grouping the peoples of at least 274
small islands between the northern tip of Cape York in Queensland and the
south-west coast of Papua New Guinea. Many Torres Strait Islander peoples live
on the Australian mainland. There are also 2 Torres Strait Islander communities
at Bamaga and Seisia, within the Northern Peninsula Area of Queensland.

### Authoritative guidance lives with the relevant community or individual

There is a legacy of writing about First Nations people without seeking their
guidance about references and terminology. Educational texts and official
websites can be inaccurate when written without consultation.

It’s important to consult with traditional owners, local elders, community and
content experts. Consultation is essential when writing about sensitive matters
like cultures and history.

Consultation protocols and respectful language use depend on the preferences of
the peoples involved. As a result, there are very few hard rules. Respectful
content and language use will always depend upon proper consultation.

### Respectful language use starts with the basics

Basic respectful language means using:

* specific terms, like the name of a community, before using broader terms
* plurals when speaking about collectives (peoples, nations, cultures, languages)
* present tense, unless speaking about a past event
* empowering, strengths-based language.

Language that can be discriminatory or offensive includes:

* shorthand terms like ‘Aborigines', ‘Islanders’ or acronyms like ‘ATSI’
* using terms like ‘myth’, ‘legend’ or ‘folklore’ when referring to the beliefs of First Nations people
* blood quantums (for example, ‘half-caste’ or percentage measures)
* ‘us versus them’ or deficit language
* possessive terms such as ‘our’, as in ‘our Aboriginal peoples’
* ‘Australian Indigenous peoples’, as it also implies ownership, much like ‘our’.

Many texts have referred to First Nations people in the past tense, for example:

* ‘The Aboriginal language existed for hundreds of years.’
* ‘Torres Strait Islanders once congregated at this place.’

This use of past tense continues the historical erasure of First Australians.

The 2 statements also show a lack of understanding about diversity within either
group.

Statements to redress the historical erasure and inaccuracy would read:

* ‘There is no such thing as “the Aboriginal language”, it would be like saying “the European language”. There are literally hundreds of First Nations languages that exist today, and have been spoken for millennia.’
* ‘The people of Iama (Yam Island) in the Torres Strait have been living there for thousands of years.’

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have always been here. They are
still undertaking cultural activities. Be conscious of this and work to change
the habit.

#### A Welcome to Country is not the same as an Acknowledgement of Country

Welcome to Country is an important ceremony for many First Australians. An
Acknowledgement of Country is a way of showing respect. Both are distinct
practices with different requirements and meanings. Always capitalise both.

A Welcome to Country is a ceremony to welcome people onto the land of the
custodians. A local traditional owner performs a Welcome to Country. The welcome
can take many forms. It might offer safe passage to visitors or outline any
responsibilities while on country. Providing a Welcome to Country is a paid
service. A traditional owner can assign a proxy if they are unable to attend
unexpectedly, though this is rare.

An Acknowledgement of Country is something anyone can do. It is a way a person
of any descent can pay respect to the local community and nation(s). It
acknowledges the custodians of the land on which a meeting is being held. And it
recognises the local community’s ongoing connection to, and care for, country.
Some organisations also include acknowledgements in email signatures, websites
and other materials.

Both are simple but important ways of paying respect. They redress the erasure
of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples on their own lands.

### First Nations diversity is reflected throughout Australia

Most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples live in urban places.
Historical stereotypes of ‘traditional’ peoples are inaccurate and can be
offensive.

A common misconception is if people have fair skin or live in a city they can’t
be a First Nations person. This could not be more wrong. For a long time,
policies dictated to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who they
could marry, and where they could live. Terms like ‘half-caste’ or ‘part
Aboriginal’ reflect these policies. These terms are deeply offensive and
hurtful.

Peoples were also forcibly removed to other locations. In every location in
Australia, remote, regional or urban, there are traditional custodians. There
may also be many different peoples currently living there. When writing about
any particular place, make sure to be inclusive of all First Nations people
living on country.

### Naming protocols are complicated, specificity is often more respectful

Always ask for people’s preferences about what they want to be called or how
they want to identify. It is usually more respectful to be specific.

Use the following hierarchy based on what you are writing.

If writing about:

* a specific group, use their nation, island or community name
* many Aboriginal nations, there may be a regional term that is better, such as ‘Murris’ or ‘Kooris’
* many Torres Strait Islander peoples or islands, there may be a regional term that is more appropriate, such as Kulkalgal (encompassing the central islands of Masig, Poruma, Warraber and Iama)
* both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, use terms such as ‘First Nations people’, ‘First Australians’ or ‘Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander peoples’.

#### The issue with general terms and when to use them

‘Indigenous’ and ‘Aboriginal’ are broad terms imposed on First Australians
without consultation. These are not words they chose for themselves.

While the term ‘Indigenous Australians’ is in common use, many First Australians
may not be comfortable with it.

Using ‘Indigenous Australians’ to refer to First Australians is relatively
recent. Its use became popular through international discussions, where the term
‘indigenous’ is appropriate (with a lower case ‘i’). But it is a blanket term
that homogenises a wide array of peoples and cultures. This can cause offence.

Due to the common use of ‘Indigenous Australians’ in our society, there may be
times when you can’t avoid the term. It can come up in discussions with
government organisations, in the names of some organisations or in grant
applications.

If you must use it, remember to only do so when writing generally about
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The term should always appear as
‘Indigenous Australians’ in the first instance, always with a capital ‘I’.
Afterward you can use ‘Indigenous’, capitalised, so long as the context is
correct and clear. Using ‘Indigenous’ alone is inaccurate.

<example> 
‘Indigenous Australians’ is a broad term and covers a large array of peoples.
Often Indigenous peoples themselves do not identify using this term, they will
use their local community, island or language group.

Indigenous peoples also have regional terms that they use for specific
geographical locations, such as ‘palawa’ or ‘Noongar’ to name a couple.

</example>

Some people use Aboriginal ‘and/or’ Torres Strait Islander. This is a good idea
when the audience isn’t clear or specific. It’s also important to realise that
some individuals identify with both groups.

### Style for First Australian languages needs to recognise continuing cultures

Hundreds of distinct First Nations languages and dialects are alive and spoken
today. Never refer to them as ‘extinct’. Many communities are working to revive
their languages. The preferred term to describe these languages is ‘sleeping’.

#### Spelling

Written sources are often viewed as ‘better’ or more ‘reliable’ in Australia.
But spellings for words from First Australian languages are inconsistent across
many sources.

Many colonial attempts to document First Nations languages and cultures
introduced inaccuracy and misrepresentation. This includes inaccurate spellings
for names, nations and locations.

First Nations cultures are oral-based traditions. Oral sources must have
precedence. Follow the spellings that local traditional owners, elders or
community members use for words from their languages.

Consultation is essential. You can use a style sheet to record terms you have
checked with the relevant community.

#### Italics

Do not italicise names or words from First Nations languages. They are
Australian languages, not foreign languages.

#### Capitalisation and meaning

There are few firm rules for capitalisation, as different peoples have their own
preferences. Always ask the relevant community’s preferences and usages, and
follow their advice.

Many First Nations people have developed their own dialects of English as well
as creole/Kriol languages. This means common nouns used in Standard Australian
English can shift into proper nouns at times.

The information on this page follows the convention of minimal capitalisation.
But there are many First Australians who have their own preferences, and these
should always take precedence.

Examples of words that are sometimes capitalised include Elders, Country or
Traditional Custodians. Important cultural practices are also capitalised. For
example, Acknowledgement of Country and Welcome to Country.

Some words in Standard Australian English sound the same in Aboriginal English
dialects and in Torres Strait dialects, such as Yumpla Tok. But the meaning can
be very different. Words like deadly, country, elder and law are good examples.

Listen carefully to the context these words are being placed in and ask for
clarity if you need it.

<example> 
For Standard Australian English, ‘dreaming’ has a very particular meaning. For
some Aboriginal peoples, there is also another meaning.

Within some communities, the Dreaming means something very different. It refers
to a range of systems of spiritual beliefs. This term is complex. It should
always be capitalised when used in this way.

Some peoples still use ‘the Dreamtime’. But, it has fallen out of use with many,
as it implies a timeframe or ‘past’, which is not accurate.

Some peoples use terms that don’t have an English equivalent.

</example>

### First Nations spirituality is easily misused or misrepresented

Some First Australians’ beliefs are being used in disrespectful ways. For
example, the use of ancestral beings such as the Rainbow Serpent, or Wandjinas
as a characters in ‘fictional’ stories, art or other forms of media. Most often
they are used without permission, and portrayed in deeply hurtful ways.

Sometimes wider Australian society has denigrated these beliefs. For example,
climbing Uluru in direct contradiction to requests from the traditional
custodians not to do so.

Both instances show a lack of understanding or respect for others’ beliefs. And
unfortunately, there’s a legacy of willful ignorance in this country that is
only now being addressed. As with any religion or spiritual belief, words like
‘myth’ or ‘legend’ are minimising and hurtful.

<example> 
A bunyip is a being that many Aboriginal peoples believe is real. Yet many
Australians speak of it using terms such as ‘myth’ or ‘legend’. They also use it
without permission, and appropriate it for their own purposes. Appropriating
others’ beliefs and treating them in this way is disrespectful.

</example>

It is not necessary to believe in or understand someone else’s beliefs to be
respectful of them.

### Strengths-based language respects continuous cultures and connections

Content about First Nations people has often focused on ‘problems’. This has 2
outcomes: making First Australians ‘the problem’ or continuing a deficit
discourse. Neither is acceptable.

It’s important to acknowledge the many wrongs and ongoing injustices that stem
from our shared history. And it's not about ignoring issues. But it is just as
important to acknowledge the strength of those First Australians whose cultures
survive and thrive today.

* Use empowering, strengths-based language.
* Tell positive stories.
* Emphasise ongoing connections to community, culture and country.

<example> 
The program supports First Nations people to achieve their goals.

</example>

The difference between 2 outcome statements above:

* The first has a strengths-based emphasis.
* The latter perpetuates a deficit discourse.

Be careful not to perpetuate patronising or paternalistic language use.
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and cultures are millennia old.
They are not ‘in need’ of being ‘rescued’ or ‘saved’.

It is about working together, not doing things ‘for them’ or ‘to them’. Also,
setting up a dichotomy of ‘us' and ‘them’ perpetuates division and exclusion.
This language use is not acceptable.

### Consultation is a must

Consultation starts with elders of any given community. They might not be living
on their traditional lands, or there might be multiple groups to consult.

If it’s not clear who you need to talk to, there are many community
organisations that exist today and can help. These include land councils,
housing, medical, legal or social organisations.

These groups will likely have a direct link to traditional owners and/or elders
they can help you contact.

There is clear information about communities within the region on the [Torres
Strait Regional Authority's website](http://www.tsra.gov.au/). They are able to
do this because it is a geographically small area.

Mainland Australia is much larger, and there is no single body that can offer
guidance for all communities.

Cross-cultural communication is not easy. Some basic starting points include:

* Communicate clearly without jargon or acronyms.
* Understand that community concerns will take precedence over your request.
* Make sure to build in plenty of time around the request to support this. When receiving a response, listen. Body language is also important, so pay attention to what is not said.
* Understand that silence is an important part of First Australians communication.
* Do your research.

It is normal to want to avoid offending or upsetting people. In any process
mistakes will happen. If this occurs, you might have to ask for clarity. Do not
rush to fill any silence. Listen closely, apologise and try to learn from it.

When working in this manner, always give the group final control. Make sure to
return whatever is taken from the community, or ensure a returned benefit. This
includes knowledge and stories.

For full guidance around consultation visit [AIATSIS Ethical Research
Guidelines](https://aiatsis.gov.au/research/ethical-research).

Forming a working relationship with a specific group is wonderful. But
understand that this does not translate into knowledge about any other groups.

Working with content experts, such as a First Nations editor or liaison officer,
is invaluable. People in these roles can play an important role as a cultural
translator.

#### Sorry business

Sorry business is an important grieving process when someone passes. It involves
not only immediate family, but the entire community.

If a person has passed, approval must be sought from the family around the use
of their name and image. There might be some avoidance protocols you need to
adhere to.

Some communities are okay these days with the use of a name, an image, or both.
Others still request the use of neither. The community will have a way to refer
to someone in this case and can give guidance.

Always adhere to these requirements for all community members. If in doubt, ask.

Australian audiences are familiar with standard warnings about use of names,
images or voices of deceased people in many publications and media. This is a
respectful acknowledgement of sorry business practices and beliefs, and is meant
to warn others. Using a standard warning does not replace respectful
consultation with the community.

#### Permissions

The permissions process is vital and differs from standard copyright procedures.
As well as consulting with elders and/or traditional owners, there are other
steps to take. When seeking permissions for the use of any item, individuals
sometimes need to provide approvals too.

<example> 
You have images of a group of people you wish to print. You are already in
consultation with the elders or relevant family groups in the community and they
are happy with what you have. You then learn that you also have to ask the
individuals within any image for approval.

</example>

This is not a firm rule, but one example of how things can change. Always follow
the guidance of the appropriate elders or community members.

#### Use of images

Many historical images lack any contextual information. It can be impossible to
trace the names of peoples or locations that feature in the images. As a result,
it can be inappropriate and offensive to publish them. Avoid using photographs
where people are unnamed.

Illustrations and photographs should include diverse, dynamic and contemporary
representations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Visual
representations will depend on context. Just like use of terms in text, images
should be specific to the particular nation, region or community that relates to
the content.

## Age diversity

Refer to age only if it is necessary. Use respectful language and consistent
style if age is relevant.

### If age is relevant, follow style conventions

Question whether age is relevant. Avoid referring to a person’s age or an age
group if it’s not relevant.

If you need to mention age, follow style conventions:

* When the reference to age comes before a noun, punctuate it with [hyphens](/node/105).
* Unless the age reference begins a sentence, use [numerals](/node/198).

<example>
* A 39-year-old man faces court today on several charges.
* You can withdraw your super once you’re 65, even if you’re still working.
* Fourteen-year-old Jasmine Greenwood is the youngest Australian on the Paralympic Games squad.</example>

### Use respectful terms when you write about age

Avoid characterising age references when it’s not strictly relevant.

Standalone words in everyday use, like ‘old’ and ‘young’, can carry bias or
unintended subtext. Words that carry stereotypes, for example ‘elderly’, are not
acceptable.

When an age or age range is relevant to a fact, you can use the term ‘people’
with the age reference.

<example>
* Survey data showed people aged 15 to 17 years were the highest proportion of internet users.</example>

#### Inclusivity requirements

Use respectful and inclusive language that talks to the person, not their
difference. It’s the law.

Commonwealth laws include:

* [Age Discrimination Act 2004](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A01302)
* [Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03366)
* [Public Service Act 1999](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00538).

#### Older people

The term ‘older people’ is acceptable. Don’t use the term ‘old people’. It is
disrespectful.

<example>
* older people
* retired people or retirees
* older Australians
* senior Australians or seniors</example>

Choose the term that best fits the context.

<example>
* More older Australians are using smartphones to do their business.</example>

#### Young people

The most neutral term is ‘young people’. ‘Youth’ is a gender-neutral term and is
also acceptable.

Be careful using the plural ‘youths’. This is often used to refer to male youths
only and may carry other connotations.

<example>
* young people
* youth</example>

Depending on the context, you can use the words ‘adolescents’, ‘children’ and
‘babies’. ‘Kids’ can be suitable, depending on the [content’s voice and
tone](/node/40).

<example>
* The eSafety Commissioner resources for kids and young people are tailored to different reading ages.
* Children in Defence families can need support through a move.</example>

### Refer to level of study instead of age

Refer to students by the level of study they are doing, not by their age, unless
the age is relevant.

<example>
* preschool students
* high-school students
* postgraduate students</example>

Tertiary students can be many ages. Refer to them simply as ‘students’ or, in
the case of PhD students, as ‘PhD candidates’.

Avoid using ‘mature-age student’ unless it is relevant to what you are writing.

## Cultural and linguistic diversity

Australians have different cultural backgrounds and speak many languages. Use
inclusive language that respects this diversity.

### Speak to the person, not their difference

Use inclusive language. You can use the general term ‘multicultural communities’
to write about people from different cultural backgrounds.

People writing for government sometimes use the term ‘culturally and
linguistically diverse’ (CALD) communities. Avoid using the acronym unless
you’re speaking to a specialist audience.

#### Inclusivity requirements

Use respectful and inclusive language that talks to the person, not their
difference. In Australia, it’s the law.

Commonwealth laws include:

* [Racial Discrimination Act 1975](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00274)
* [Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03366)
* [Public Service Act 1999](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00538).

Mention people’s cultural affinity or identity only when you need to.

Australians speak many different languages and have different cultural and
religious beliefs. Each culture has its own values and beliefs. You can be
sensitive to these differences when you write, through doing [user
research](/node/76).

Avoid using words such as ‘ethnic Australians’ or ‘ethnic groups’. This can
imply that migrant heritage or migrant status is unusual.

### Refer to people living in Australia as ‘Australians’

The meaning of the word ‘Australian’ can vary in different contexts. It could
mean anyone who lives in Australia. Legally, it could mean only people who are
Australian citizens.

Depending on the type of content, you might need to explain what you mean by the
term. For example, ‘Australian students’ could refer to all students in
Australia including international students.

Mention heritage, cultural or other national identity only if it’s necessary.
Consult guidance on how to refer to [nationalities, peoples and places outside
of
Australia](/node/133##write_nationalities_peoples_and_places_with_initial_capitals).

When you specify a dual identity or other heritage as an adjective, connect the
reference and the term ‘Australian’ with an [en dash](/node/199).

<example> 
The Japanese–Australian community takes part in the Summer Festival in
Melbourne. [Dual identity expressed as an
[adjective](/node/199##join_nouns_with_en_dashes_to_show_equal_relationships)]

Japanese Australians take part in the Summer Festival in Melbourne. [Dual
identity expressed as a [noun phrase](/node/144##noun_phrases_function_as_nouns)]

</example>

To refer to people who have recently arrived in Australia, use the words:

* ‘migrants’
* ‘immigrants’
* ‘new arrivals’.

These words don’t say anything about a person’s culture or language: they are
neutral. Don’t use these words once people have settled and become Australian
citizens. They suggest a temporary or marginal status.

### Use the terms ‘given name’ and ‘family name’

Many naming systems around the world differ from those used in English-speaking
countries.

Given names come before family names in English-speaking countries. In some
Asian cultures, people write the family name first.

<example> 
* Wong Hei
* Takeshi Noboyuki
</example>

This is not always obvious when the names are unfamiliar. Sometimes, the owners
of names foresee the possible confusion for English speakers. They reverse the
order in an English-speaking context.

<example> 
* Hei Wong
* Noboyuki Takeshi
</example>

When you ask people their name, don’t ask for ‘Christian name’, ‘first name’,
‘forename’ or ‘surname’. These terms all take for granted the European
conventions and order of names.

Instead, ask for their:

* given name
* family name.

Some people state a preferred name instead of their given name. This could be
different from their legal name, so be clear about which you need.

Other countries have variations of name order. For example:

* In Indonesia, some people have only one name. They might use this in Australia for both their given name and family name to conform with Western conventions.
* In Myanmar, names are not divided into given and family names. These names keep their full form instead.

For more on this rule, refer to guidance on [personal
names](/node/90##follow_reliable_sources_for_nonenglish_names).

## Gender and sexual diversity

Inclusive language conveys gender equality and is gender neutral. Respect
people’s gender and sexual identity with pronoun choice, job titles and personal
titles.

### Use gender-neutral language

Use terms that recognise gender equality. Avoid terms that discriminate on the
basis of a person’s gender or sexual identity.

Our use of language reflects changes in society. There is wide agreement about
using language to support equality between all genders.

#### Inclusivity requirements

It is unlawful to discriminate against a person under the [Sex Discrimination
Act 1984](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02868). This
discrimination relates to their:

* sex
* marital or relationship status
* actual or potential pregnancy
* sexual orientation
* gender identity
* intersex status.

It is also unlawful to discriminate against a person because they are
breastfeeding.

#### Pronoun choice

Learn the user’s [pronoun](/node/131). If it’s not clear and you can’t ask them,
choose gender-neutral pronouns.

The singular ‘they’ is gender-neutral. It avoids specifying a person’s gender.

You can use ‘they’ or ‘them’ when you would otherwise use a singular personal
pronoun such as:

* ‘he’
* ‘she’
* ‘him’
* ‘her’.

You can also use ‘themselves’ or ‘themself’ instead of ‘himself’ or ‘herself’.
‘Themself’ is an extension of using ‘they’ for a single person.

The use of gender-neutral pronouns to refer to a person of unknown gender has a
long history. Usage now covers people who either:

* don’t wish to identify as a particular gender
* identify as non-binary or gender-fluid.

There are many ways to avoid using gender-specific pronouns.

<example>
You must provide copies of the application to your referees. [Use the
second-person pronouns (‘you’ and ‘your’) with direct tone and active voice.]

Candidates must provide copies of the application to their referees. [Use a
plural pronoun. The pronoun ‘their’ relates to a plural subject ‘candidates’.]

Every candidate must provide copies of the application to referees. [Leave the
pronoun out altogether.]</example>

#### Avoid gender-specific job titles

Avoid using job titles that end in ‘-man’ or ‘-woman’.

Avoid using the traditional terms for jobs that end in ‘-man’.

<example>
* police officer
* minister of religion
* firefighter
* supervisor</example>

You should also avoid job terms that specify women.

<example>
* actor
* host
* waiter
* flight attendant</example>

Gender is not relevant to a person’s profession or title in general. Use
gender-specific adjectives only when gender is relevant. For example, an
economic analysis might discuss ‘female-dominated’ or ‘male-dominated’
industries.

#### Titles ‘Ms’ and ‘Mx’

‘Ms’ is now widely used instead of ‘Mrs’ or ‘Miss’. It does not disclose marital
status.

‘Mx’ refers to non-binary people and those who do not wish to be referred to by
their gender. Use ‘Mx’ when a person indicates this is what they prefer, but not
otherwise.

Forms and surveys can ask for people to specify gender. Don’t ask for a title or
gender identity [unless the form is designed to collect this
information](/node/177). For example, a form can ask for [a person’s given and
family name](/node/59). It does not need to ask for their preferred title.

### Check for changes in language use

Take care in areas where language is changing. Follow the rule that people have
the right to identify their sexual orientation and gender identity as they
choose.

The discussion is still evolving about words for other aspects of gender and
sexual diversity.

#### Gender and sexual diversity terms

It can help to know the meanings of words people use about gender and sexual
diversity. This includes sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and
sex characteristics.

* ‘Gender’ is about social and cultural differences and identity. ‘Gender’ and ‘sex’ both mean ‘the state of being male or female’ but are often used in different ways.
* ‘Gender expression’ is the way a person expresses their gender.
* ‘Gender identity’ is about who a person feels themself to be. It refers to the way a person identifies or expresses their masculine or feminine traits.
* ‘Gender-queer’ and ‘non-binary’ refer to people who don’t identify as either male or female. They may identify as both or neither. ‘Gender-fluid’ refers to people who do not identify with a fixed gender.
* ‘Intersex’ refers to people with innate genetic, hormonal or physical sex characteristics that do not conform to medical norms for female or male bodies.
* ‘Sex’ refers to the legal status that was initially determined by sex characteristics observed at birth.
* ‘Sex characteristics’ are a person’s physical sex features, such as their chromosomes, hormones and reproductive organs.
* ‘Sexual orientation’ is a person’s romantic or sexual attraction to another person, such as heterosexual, gay, lesbian or bisexual.
* ‘Sexuality’ includes biological sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy and reproduction.
* ‘Transgender’ means people whose gender identity is different from that given to them at birth.

These are not the only ways to use these words. The definitions highlight some
of the main points and distinctions. For more advice on these terms, go to:

* the [Human Rights Commission](https://www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/lgbti/terminology)
* the [Australian Institute of Family Studies](https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/publications/lgbtiq-communities)
* [Intersex Human Rights Australia](https://ihra.org.au/style/).

#### LGBTI and LGBTIQ+ communities

The term LGBT arose in the 1990s to refer to lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender people. The term has since expanded to LGBTI, to include intersex
people. LGBTI is now widely accepted and used.

Recently, the term has expanded again to LGBTIQ, LGBTIQ+ or LGBTIQA+. The ‘Q’
refers to the queer community or to people questioning their gender identity.
The ‘A’ refers to asexual people. The newer terms are used less frequently. The
use of ‘+’ represents other sexual identities.

Australian Government agencies use both LGBTI and LGBTIQ+.

‘SOGIESC’ is a term writers use when discussing law and policy. It refers to
‘sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics’.
This term replaces the earlier term ‘SOGII’. It referred to ‘sexual orientation,
gender identity and intersex’ issues.

## People with disability

Disability does not define people. Use inclusive language that respects
diversity.

### Focus on the person, not the disability

Mention disability only when it’s relevant to the content.

When you are writing about people with disability, focus on the person. Engage
with people through [user
research](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/build-and-improve-services/user-research).

User research can uncover whether an individual or community preference is:

* person-first language
* identity-first language.

Use person-first language for Australian Government content, unless user
research says otherwise.

<example>
* people with disability [Person-first language]
* disabled person [Identity-first language]</example>

Be responsive if you get feedback on the language you’ve used. It can guide user
research around language that respects individual or community preferences.

#### Accessibility and inclusivity requirements

You must design accessible content to meet the Digital Service Standard:

* [Criterion 1. Understand user needs](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/1-understand-user-needs)
* [Criterion 9. Make it accessible](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/9-make-it-accessible)

You must make all government content accessible to people with disability.

Use respectful and inclusive language that talks to the person – not their
difference.

Commonwealth laws include:

* [Disability Discrimination Act 1992](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04426)
* [Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03366)

### Use respectful language

Respectful language acknowledges peoples’ preferences to identify with a
particular community or characteristic.

Terms should not identify people without an understanding of personal
preference. For example, many people who are deaf or hard of hearing may
identify as ‘Deaf’ – a cultural group with a different first language.

Avoid using the disability as an adjective that defines the person, unless that
is their preference. Use the word ‘disability’ as an [uncountable
noun](/node/122).

Use person-first language when you don’t understand individual or community
preferences. Describe the person and then the characteristic.

<example>
* person with disability
* person who is deaf or hard of hearing
* person who is blind or has low vision
* person living with disability
* person with mental illness, person with psychosocial disability, person with a psychiatric condition
* person with intellectual disability, person with developmental disability
* person with learning disability
* person with cognitive disability
* person who uses a wheelchair or mobility device
* person with reduced mobility
* person with physical disability
* accessible parking</example>

You can cause offence when you do not use respectful language, even if it is
well intentioned.

* Don’t say a person is inspirational only because of their disability.
* Don’t write about people as if they are heroes or victims.
* Avoid euphemisms and made-up terms, such as ‘differently abled’ and ‘handicapable’.

People with disability could consider these types of terms condescending.

When you are making comparisons, write:

* ‘person without disability’ – rather than ‘able-bodied’
* ‘sighted person’ for someone who is not blind
* ‘hearing person’ for someone who is not deaf
* ‘neurotypical’ for someone who is not autistic.

#### The social model of disability

The traditional view of disability has been a medical model. In this approach,
disability is a health condition for health professionals to treat, fix or cure.

Many people with disability prefer another approach: the social model of
disability. This is a way to understand how people with disability interact with
their environment and others in society.

The social model is about shifting the problem from individual impairments to
the social environment that people operate in.

From this viewpoint, disability arises from the way people with disability
interact with the world. They encounter physical barriers, digital barriers and
barriers of attitudes and communication. These block their participation in
society.

The social model recognises the reality of a disability and its effects. By
contrast, the medical model looks at impairments that create a medical
condition.

The Australian Federation of Disability Organisations has [more information on
the social model of
disability](https://www.afdo.org.au/social-model-of-disability/).

Advocates of the social model of disability focus on the barriers to
participating in society faced by people living with disability.

#### People who are blind or have low vision

‘Legal blindness’ and being ‘legally blind’ have specific definitions. In
government use, these terms relate a person's sight loss to eligibility
criteria. Many people who are legally blind do have some vision.

The terms ‘blind’ and ‘low vision’ include people with no sight and people who
have some sight.

A person who is totally blind does not perceive light and has no usable vision.
A person who has low vision has some ability to see. Wearing regular glasses
will not improve their vision.

A person who is blind or who has low vision might use screen reading software,
Braille displays, or screen magnification technology to access content. People
who are blind might use other ways to communicate using hearing or touch.

Acceptable terms include ‘person who is blind’ and ‘person who has low vision’.
Don’t write ‘the blind’ or ‘person without sight’.

#### People who are deaf or hard of hearing

The terms ‘deaf’ and ‘hard of hearing’ include people with no hearing or limited
hearing. They might have difficulty using audio content. If you are providing
audio content, make the information available in other ways – such as captions
and a transcript.

The World Federation of the Deaf disapproves of the term ‘hearing impaired’ as
it describes people as if they have a deficiency.

Refer to someone with hearing loss as a ‘person who is deaf or hard of hearing’.

Some people who are deaf or hard of hearing use the Australian sign language,
Auslan. Some people who are deaf or hard of hearing view themselves as members
of a community and language group. This community calls itself the Deaf
community, and encourages others to do the same. The Deaf community uses the
term with a capital letter ‘D’ as a mark of its identity.

Members of the Deaf community might still use deaf with a lowercase ‘d’ to refer
to their hearing.

#### People with cognitive disability

People with cognitive disability include people with intellectual disability,
acquired brain injury or dementia.

‘Cognitive disability’ is a broad term that covers a range of conditions. Genes,
illnesses, injury, physical factors or environmental factors may cause cognitive
disability.

Creating content in more than one format, such as making an Easy Read version,
can help some people with cognitive disability access information. Follow W3C
updates on [making content usable for people with cognitive and learning
disabilities](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/).

#### People with learning disability

People with ‘learning disability’ might have difficulty planning and difficulty
processing new information. The causes are neurological. They are difficult to
address and can be lifelong.

Some Australian support groups and educators use ‘learning difficulty’ and
‘learning disability’ for all people who have difficulty learning a basic
academic skill.

Learning disability is not the same as a learning difficulty, which can be
overcome with intensive teaching or training. Learning difficulties are not
generally considered to be disability.

Examples of learning disabilities are dyslexia (reading), dyscalculia
(mathematics) and various auditory processing disorders (sound and verbal
instructions). Having a learning disability is not related to intelligence.

#### People with mental illness

‘Mental illness’ is a broad term that covers many different conditions that
influence the way people act, think, feel or see the world.

The term ‘psychosocial disability’ is specific to some people with severe mental
health conditions. It covers both psychological and social factors. It focuses
on restrictions on participating in society. Not every mental illness involves a
psychosocial disability.

Some ways of talking about mental illness can cause offence.

Use people-first language when you refer to a person with mental illness.

<example>
* people with mental illness
* people with mental ill-health</example>

Describe the person as ‘having’ mental illness, just as you would for any other
illness or injury. Don’t describe the person as ‘being’ a disease.

<example>
* Rupert has schizophrenia.
* Alice has depression.
* Lu has bipolar disorder.</example>

Mental illness sometimes attracts social stigma. This stigma may prevent people
from acknowledging their mental health conditions and talking about them with
others.

There is advice about the best language to use for mental illness in guides from
the [Australian Human Rights
Commission](https://www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/appendix-c-how-talk-about-mental-illness)
and
[Everymind](https://everymind.org.au/understanding-mental-health/mental-health/language-and-stigma).

#### Neurodiversity

The term ‘neurodiversity’ refers to the idea that neurological differences, such
as autism and ADHD, sit within the normal spectrum of human variation.
Neurological differences are not always a disability. Advocates refer to the
diverse range of differences in the brain and behaviour. They say societal
barriers are the main factors disabling people.

Neurodiversity was first used for people on the autism spectrum. It is now also
applied to other conditions, such as dyslexia.

## Literacy and access

Literacy can be a barrier to access for Australian users. Writing to an
Australian year 7 level makes content usable for most people.

### Literacy affects access to government services and information

Literacy is a person’s ability to read and write. It is also how well they can
access written text in digital and print formats.

The effect of literacy on people’s lives is profound. It influences how they
interact with each other and how they approach education, work and government.

Low literacy can make it hard to access government services and information.

Factors that affect literacy in English include:

* where people live
* their [linguistic background](/node/59)
* their education
* how old they are
* their [abilities and limitations](/node/69)
* how they access information.

#### Accessibility requirements
User need:

I can read and understand text, even if the content includes unusual words,
shortened forms, or features languages other than English.

Fundamentals:

* Write in plain language. This helps all users and is essential for some.
* Level AAA requires a lower secondary education reading level, after removal of proper names and titles (year 7 or between 12 and 14 years old).
* Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases, idioms and so on.
* Expand all acronyms on their first use.
* Avoid using double negatives.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [3.1.5 Reading level – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##reading-level)
* [3.1.3 Unusual words – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##unusual-words)
* [3.1.4 Abbreviations – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##abbreviations)

#### Reading levels in Australia

‘Reading level’ is the level of education someone needs to be able to read text.
It is one way to measure literacy.

In Australia:

* about 44% of adults read at literacy level 1 to 2 (a low level)
* 38% of adults read at level 3
* about 15% read at level 4 to 5 (the highest level).

People at a reading level 1 read at a primary school equivalent level. They can
understand short sentences.

 Australian adult reading levelsReading levelPercentage of adults at each level (%)Pre-primary level (below level 1)3.7Pre-year 1 to year 6 (level 1)10.0Year 7 to year 10 (level 2)30.0Years 11 and 12 (level 3)38.0Certificate IV (level 4)14.0Diploma and above (level 5)1.2 

Note: Percentages do not add to 100.

Sources: Reading level statistics are from ABS (2013). Australian school-level
equivalents for each OECD classification level are from ABS et al. (2017).

#### Education and literacy

People with higher literacy – as measured by reading level – generally have had
access to a better education.

Many factors influence people’s access to education, including where they live.

Post-school education is easier to access if you live in a major city. For
example, people in cities are more likely to have a bachelor degree than people
in regional areas. But there are also areas of disadvantage in the major cities.

An education doesn’t guarantee a reading level that matches the qualification.
For example, about 30% of Australians have a diploma or higher, but only 1.2% of
Australians can read at that level.

Many people maintain their high-school reading level even if they go on to
tertiary studies.

### Clear content helps all users

Regardless of literacy levels, all users want to be able to interact with
government easily. Respect their time by writing in [plain language](/node/55).
Check that your content is a reading level 2 (Australian year 7 equivalent).
This level also helps users with higher literacy.

Users with higher education also prefer content that’s easy to read. People with
the highest literacy levels tend to be time-poor and have the most to read. The
preference for plain English increases with:

* a person’s level of education
* the complexity of the topic.

Content for general consumption needs to be accessible by everyone, regardless
of literacy. Specialist content is more accessible for technical users when
written in plain language.

#### Understanding users

Before you start writing, do [user research](/node/76). Don’t assume that
everyone can access, read and understand what you write.

Always make it simple for people to get what they need to do with government
done. People might need an alternative to the digital service.

##### Digital Service Standard requirements

You must understand the needs of all users of your service and create content
they can access to meet the Digital Service Standard:

* [Criterion 1. Understand user needs](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/1-understand-user-needs)
* [Criterion 9. Make it accessible](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/9-make-it-accessible).

Ensure that people who use the digital service can also use the other available
channels, if needed, without repetition or confusion.

Do user research to understand how people interact with government services or
information. Ensure users with low literacy have equal access.

[Criterion 12. Don’t forget the non-digital
experience](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/12-dont-forget-non-digital-experience)

## Make content accessible

People can experience ongoing, temporary or situational barriers to access
information they need. Help them by designing accessible and inclusive content.

### Make content accessible

Accessibility is about inclusion.

Government services and products need to be available to everyone. This means
creating inclusive content.

Inclusive content recognises:

* Australia’s diversity
* the diversity of technology Australians use to engage online.

For example, inclusive content accommodates:

* cultural and linguistic diversity among users
* diversity of abilities among users
* how users interact with technology in different contexts.

The Australian Government's aim is that all government services are digital
first. This aim is described in the [Government Digital
Strategy](https://www.dta.gov.au/digital-government-strategy).

Australian Government digital services must be usable and accessible – a
requirement under the [Digital Service
Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/about-digital-service-standard).

### Follow accessibility guidance in context

Style Manual topics give you the guidance you need to follow to create
accessible content. Where there are specific accessibility requirements or
guidance, the Style Manual provides callouts to make it clear what you need to
do.

This is an example of an accessibility callout.

### Style Manual guidance

In addition to this contextual guidance, the Style Manual also provides
information on:

* designing for accessibility and inclusion
* applying the principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
* the responsibilities of government agencies.

This guidance supports agencies in meeting accessibility requirements. The Style
Manual does not provide technical guidance or support for developers and site
owners on meeting specific accessibility requirements.

## Blogs

Blog posts can help users solve common problems. Use clear structures and ensure
content is accessible. Moderate comments if you allow them.

### Find out if a blog will meet a user need

Create a blog if it will help people find and use government services and
products.

Before starting a blog, do [user research](/node/76). Find out if people will
use the blog and why.

Blogs can support user needs by:

* detailing one aspect of a service or product
* giving information about policy issues
* highlighting innovations, research and best practice
* inviting feedback.

Don’t use blogs for essential information that should be stand-alone content.
Don’t duplicate information that’s available elsewhere.

<example>
Curious about what goes on at the museum? These blogs give you an inside peek. [Blog posts focus on aspects of a service.]</example>

Things to consider before starting a blog include:

* What do users want to know about your organisation’s services?
* Does a blog fit with your organisation’s content strategy?
* What will a blog add that users can’t find elsewhere?
* How will a blog fit with your organisation’s goals and its communications strategy?
* Would it be useful to allow comments, and do you have the dedicated staff to monitor them?

### Plan blog posts with a specific purpose and structure

Update the blog regularly. For example, aim for a new post once a week on the
same day. But make sure you have something useful to say.

A blog post should solve users’ problems or answer their questions. Common
places you can find information on these include:

* user research
* search logs
* call centre and shopfront data
* social media
* web analytics
* surveys.

#### Titles, headings and text

Help users find the information they need by following the guidance for:

* [headings](/node/51)
* [paragraphs](/node/53)
* [links](/node/193)
* [lists](/node/56)
* [search engine optimisation](/node/103).

Start with a title that helps users understand what the post is about. Include
[keywords](/node/72). Avoid clickbait titles.

<example>
* How to get mental health support
* Leadership mentoring program now open
* Tips for making a grant application</example>

Break up your post with headings and short paragraphs. Order headings from most
to least important. Cover one main idea per paragraph. Keep paragraphs to a
maximum of 2 to 3 sentences so people can read them on mobile devices.

Use a warm and conversational tone in your blog posts. This will help you engage
with the people reading the blog.

<example>
Ever wanted to know what to do when hosting an ideas challenge? Our case studies open up a world of ideas and translate them into practices you can apply at work.</example>

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
* I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.
* I can easily control how I see and hear distinctions if sound and colour convey meaning.

Fundamentals:

* Write clear page titles. This is the first thing a screen reader user will hear and should align with the first heading on the page.
* Organise content with a clear structure using section headings. Clearly describe the topics or the following section in the headings.
* Make sure all users can navigate through all content in the intended order, regardless of the technology they are using. Use the same navigation elements consistently across services.
* Use images of text only where it's essential to help convey the information.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [2.4.2 Page titles – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##page-titled)
* [2.4.10 Section headings – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##section-headings)
* [2.4.6 Headings and labels – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##headings-and-labels)
* [1.3.1 Info and relationships – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##info-and-relationships)
* [1.4.9 Images of text – Level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=246##images-of-text-no-exception)

#### Images and media

Include images in blog posts if they convey meaning or interest. Unless images
are for decorative purposes, describe the visual information in [alt
text](/node/49).

Include video or audio if they meet a user need and are accessible.

##### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

I can understand any information contained in an image or media.

Fundamentals:

* Include images, video and audio on a page only if they meet a real user need. Make sure the contrast is sufficient for all users.
* Add [alt text for images](/node/49). For help with writing good alt text: the W3C [alt decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/).
* Write alternative text that describes the information or function of the image. For help to describe images: the W3C/WAI [Web Accessibility Tutorials - Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/).
* Follow the [requirements for video and audio](/node/41).

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [1.1.1 Non-text content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##non-text-content) [–](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##contrast-minimum) [level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##non-text-content)
* [1.4.2 Contrast (minimum) – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##contrast-minimum)
* [1.4.6 Contrast (extended) – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##contrast-enhanced)
* [1.4.11 Non-text contrast – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##non-text-contrast)

##### Copyright requirements

You must get permission (a licence) to use copyright material. This includes
images, video and audio.

Some material is available under an open access licence, such as [Creative
Commons](https://creativecommons.org.au/).

Read the government copyright rules in the [Australian Government intellectual
property
manual](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

##### Privacy requirements

Your organisation has obligations under the [Privacy Act
1988](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/).

Privacy is relevant whenever it's possible to identify someone. Treat things
that can or might identify an individual as personal information. A blog might
feature someone's picture as an image or in a video, for example.

When you handle personal information, you must comply with the [Australian
Privacy
Principles](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/).
Personal information is any information that could identify an individual, in
any format.

#### Call to action

Include a call to action at the end of your post. Examples of calls to action
include invitations to:

* take the next step in using the service or product
* give feedback
* get emails about new posts or news items
* subscribe to a newsletter
* get more detailed information on a topic
* respond to a survey.

<example>
To bookmark the topics you find most useful, visit the [Style
Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/).</example>

#### Promotion

Promote your blog post on [social media](/node/43). Tailor content to suit each
platform.

### Manage comments if you decide to allow them

Blogs can encourage dialogue with people who use government services and
products.

There are benefits in allowing comments. If you involve readers by publishing
their comments, they are more likely to return to the blog. By responding to
comments, you can increase engagement with the content.

Allowing comments on blogs also has a downside. Comments sections often attract
trivial or hostile responses. You will need to moderate comments before
publishing them.

Government blogs are official communication channels and speak for the
government, so those who reply need to have the authority to make official
comments.

A blog that allows comments needs dedicated moderators. It can become
unmanageable if there are many comments.

Social media has mostly replaced blogs for the purpose of encouraging comments.

##### Information management requirements

Blogs that you create for the Australian Government become records. Records
provide evidence of what your organisation has done and why.

Managing and disposing of records properly is a requirement under the [Archives
Act 1983](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796). You must follow
your organisation’s information management requirements. Visit the National
Archives of Australia website for [information management
standards](https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/information-management-standards).

## Easy Read

Easy Read combines text with layout and imagery to simplify and explain
information. Users often print Easy Read materials. The standard layout works as
a handout.

### Create Easy Read to broaden access

The aim of Easy Read is to give more people access to information.

Easy Read is a way to present information for people who are not familiar with
English, or who have low literacy or [learning disability](/node/69).

Easy Read’s unique layout and style presents information so it’s easy to
understand. The content can explain complex information about law, policy or
obligations.

Easy Read often involves using images to complement the text. It can be a good
basis for translating content into other languages.

### Identify user needs

Before starting, make sure you do research with people who will use the
information. Find out how they will access the materials – in print, online or
with support from others.

Not everyone will find Easy Read useful: check the findings from your [user
research](/node/76). You might find people prefer other formats, such as video
or a webpage.

### Engage Easy Read experts

It is best to engage Easy Read experts. They will know how to research and
communicate with specific user groups.

They will also have expertise on design. Easy Read professionals are experienced
in connecting language and imagery to help users understand and consume
information.

### Design and publish materials to download

Design your Easy Read materials as a printed handout to be used by people in
several scenarios. For example, employers, support workers, family or carers
might use the materials to talk something through with people who need to use
the information.

Make Easy Read materials available in addition to any source material they are
derived from. Publish them in HTML and as an accessible PDF at the same time as
the source material.

Users need to be able to print or download the Easy Read version from the same
site as the source material.

#### Print considerations

Publishing Easy Read as a PDF means it may be read online or printed. When you
have links in the materials, you need to:

* provide clear link text and make sure it looks like a link
* spell out the URL next to the linked text.

#### Accessibility considerations

User needs:

I can follow the design, structure and language of the content.

Fundamentals:

* Follow W3C updates on [making content usable for people with cognitive and learning disabilities](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/).
* Make the structure of Easy Read PDFs accessible to help people who will need to download them from the website.
* Make all government content accessible to people with disability. This includes providing information that is timely, which is part of Australian law under the [Disability Discrimination Act 1992](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04426).

Guidance on EPUB and PDF accessibility:

* [Overview of the EPUB specification](https://inclusivepublishing.org/publisher/epub/)
* [EPUB accessibility](http://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/conformance/epub.html)
* [PDF techniques for WCAG 2.0 – W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/pdf.html)
* [General techniques for WCAG 2.0 – W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/general.html)
* [Accessibility for Adobe Acrobat – Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/acrobat.html)
* [Accessibility for Adobe InDesign – Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/indesign.html)

### Plan the structure

Think of the Easy Read version as a summary of the source material. This helps
you plan the structure and determine the level of detail to include.

Identify the main points to cover and decide how to explain them. Include
examples throughout to help explain ideas and concepts.

Your research will help you decide if you need images. Ask your Easy Read expert
to help you choose images users can relate to and understand. Users will be
drawn to the images first to derive meaning, before looking at the adjacent
text.

### Keep text simple

Easy Read follows some plain language principles – such as using simple words
and sentences – but Easy Read and plain language are different.

Differences between Easy Read and plain languageEasy ReadPlain languageFocus is on simplicityFocus is on clarityText and images carry the meaningText carries the meaningLarge font sizeStandard font sizeOften, another person reads the content to the intended userContent is read by the intended user

Check your content reads between a year 4 to year 6 reading level. Use simple
words and grammar, but don’t use childish language if the users are adults.

#### Difficult words

Some important words might be hard for people to read and understand. A
difficult word might have 3 or more syllables.

* If you need to use a difficult word, write it in **bold.**
* Define the difficult word in the next sentence or phrase.
* If you have defined a lot of words, include a glossary at the end of your document. Call it a word list.

<example>
* **Immunisation** protects your baby from some diseases.
* Immunisation means a doctor or nurse gives your baby a needle with a **vaccine** inside.
* The vaccine is the medicine that protects your baby from some diseases.</example>

#### Avoid questions in the text

Only use questions in headings for Easy Read. Questions in the text can make
some people anxious. They might feel that they have to answer and worry about
how to respond.

If you need information from people, follow questions with practical examples so
people know how to respond. Ask your Easy Read professional to help you design
these materials.

<example>
       A heading in Easy Read that is phrased as a question </example>

### Involve others as you draft

Involve people from your target user group as you write, design and test the
materials. They can help you to choose imagery and to use terms they use
themselves.

Ask your Easy Read professional to help you find or create images that convey
meaning.

When you finish the draft, check with the original author to make sure you have
the meaning right.

Keep your Easy Read brief. This is not always possible for complex information.
In that case, think about whether you can divide the content into a few
documents. Check if this decision will meet user needs.

#### Information management requirements

Content that you create as part of your work for the Australian Government is a
record. Records provide evidence of what your organisation has done and why.

Managing and disposing of records is required under the [Archives Act
1983](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796). For guidance, visit
the National Archives of Australia’s [information management
standards](https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/information-management-standards).

### Follow a standard Easy Read layout

Easy Read layout creates a relationship between images and text.

Use a consistent layout and minimum design elements so it’s easy for people to
use or explain. Your agency might have an Easy Read publishing template. Find
out before using a table grid to format images and text.

Tables help to align images and words. If you use them, follow [accessibility
requirements for tables](/node/45). When designing the Easy Read material, code
tables using the [role="presentation"
attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-wai-aria-1.1-20171214/##presentation).

In a standard Easy Read layout:

* Use wide margins and plenty of white space to make the text easy to read.
* Use at least 1.5 line spacing.
* If you’re using images, place them on the left to align with the text on the right.
* Don’t put images above the text or vice versa.
* Left-align the text.

To format text:

* Use at least size 14 font for text and a larger size for headings.
* Only use **bold** for headings and difficult words.
* Be careful using text effects – any change to the shape of letters makes them more difficult to read.
* Use colour and contrast to make words stand out, but don’t rely on colour to convey meaning.

#### Print considerations

* Don’t split paragraphs and sentences across pages in print and PDF documents.
* Insert page numbers in print and PDF documents, in the same font size as your text.
* Use matte paper stock: it reduces glare off the page.
* Include your agency or department logo on the cover page only.

### Provide context

Users need to understand the reason for the material, how to use it and how to
find out more.

At the beginning of the content:

* introduce your organisation
* explain how to use it – images with text, difficult words and links
* add words to reassure people that it’s okay to ask someone else to help them read it
* explain how the Easy Read relates to other content – as a summary or guide
* provide a URL or a hyperlink to the standard version (for digital content)
* include a list of contents if there are several pages.

At the end, add:

* where people can find more information
* a word list if there are a lot of difficult words
* ‘contact us’ information.

You might add:

* a word count
* information about other services
* other resources.

## Emails and letters

Concise letters and emails tell a recipient what they need to know. Use the
right level of formality for the recipient and purpose. Be mindful of people’s
privacy.

### Identify the user and purpose

The user (recipient) and the purpose determine whether you use an email or a
letter.

The level of formality in the writing depends on the recipient and the purpose.

When you write emails or letters for work, use the right format and tone for the
purpose.

Users vary. They include:

* people outside government
* colleagues in the department or agency
* colleagues in other departments or agencies.

Consider the kind of relationship that you have with the recipient.

Emails and letters have many purposes. These include:

* providing or seeking information
* giving advice or requiring action to enforce a law or regulation
* taking part in a discussion or negotiation about a topic or issue.

### Assess the formality based on context and policy

Letters are more formal than emails, but the differences are becoming blurred.
Emails are now used for some formal official correspondence.

The more formal the purpose, the more likely it is that you will use a letter
instead of an email. But the choice is not clear-cut and depends on your
organisation’s preferences. Make sure you know what they are.

<example>
* In formal correspondence requiring a person to comply with a law, you would be more likely to write a letter.
* In informal correspondence between colleagues working together, you would be more likely to use an email.</example>

### Write in clear language with appropriate tone

Always write in [plain language](/node/55).

Consider the needs of the person who will get the email or letter and [choose
the right tone](/node/40).

#### Access to information requirements

The [Freedom of Information Act
1982](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02562) gives people the right
to request access to government-held information. This includes emails and
letters.

If you write in government, the email or letter you write could become public.
Emails and letters can be subject to freedom of information requests. They could
also be used as evidence during legal proceedings.

### Confirm privacy rules before you write to someone

Take steps to confirm details are up-to-date before sending letters containing
personal information.

#### Privacy requirements and permissions

Your organisation has obligations under the [Privacy Act
1988](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/).

When you handle personal information, you must comply with the [Australian
Privacy
Principles](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/).
Personal information is any information that could identify an individual, in
any format.

You must prevent unintended transmission of personal information via email.
Emails need to be sent securely and to the correct recipient. Check your
organisation’s processes and procedures for the secure transmission of personal
information.

For letters sent by post, consider using registered post. This requires
signature on delivery to ensure the letter is delivered to the correct
recipient.

The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner has more guidance in its
[Guide to securing personal
information](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/guide-to-securing-personal-information/).

You must have someone’s explicit permission to add them to a mailing list and
you must give them the option to unsubscribe.

Your organisation might also have obligations under the [Spam Act
2003](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A01214). The Australian
Communications and Media Authority can provide [guidance about emailing
promotional content via a distribution
list](https://www.acma.gov.au/avoid-sending-spam).

#### Address blocks

Include the recipient’s name and postal address at the top of the letter. Make
sure the recipient’s details are correct.

If you’re sending a letter to someone in an organisation, include:

* the recipient’s position
* the branch or division they work in
* the name of the organisation.

Use information only if it is accurate, up to date, complete and relevant. If
necessary, contact a recipient to confirm their address.

#### Emailed letters

For letters you send electronically:

* Consider using secure messaging services like myGov rather than email.
* With emails, explain in the covering text that the email has a letter attached.

Electronic letters are more accessible for some people than paper letters. For
example, a person who is blind or has low vision can access electronic documents
by using screen-reading software.

#### CC and BCC fields

Send emails to people only if they need the information.

Copy people into an email if they need the email for information only.

* Include recipients in the ‘To’ field only if you need them to act on something in the email.
* Use the ‘CC’ field if people all know each other or can look up an email address with ease.
* Use the ‘BCC’ field to send an email to a group of people who don’t know each other. Use of BCC protects people’s privacy by not disclosing their name or email address.

### Use your organisation’s letter templates

Use the organisation’s template for letters. The template will include any
branding you need to use, including letterhead.

Using a template helps the recipient know that the letter is official and that
they can trust it. It is also part of the organisation’s brand and shows
consistency.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can understand any information contained in an image.
* I can read and understand text, even if there are unusual words and shortened words, or languages other than English.
* I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.

Fundamentals:

* To enable mobile device screen readers to access the file, use an accessible file format.
* For images in emails and digital letters, use [alt text](/node/49).
* Consider accessibility when sending attachments. For example, don’t send PDF attachments if the recipient could be using a mobile device to read the email.
* Don't send images unless they're referred to and described in the text.
* Make sure any links are easily found and work properly.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [3.1 Readable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##readable)
* [1.1.1 Non-text content – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##non-text-content)
* [1.3.1 Info and relationships – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##info-and-relationships)

### Include dates in letters

Include the date you are sending the letter so that the recipient knows when you
wrote it. This is especially important if they need to do something or if you
are notifying them of a decision.

### Write a clear and concise subject line

Be clear and concise with the subject line. It should sum up the purpose of the
email.

Write the subject line as a heading that helps people know what is in the email
and why they should read it. As for all headings, it is good practice to put the
main idea first. This is especially helpful when people read emails on smaller
screens. A long subject line might not be displayed in full on smaller screens.

People are more likely to open an email if the subject is clear. It is also
easier to find the email later.

Avoid using expressions and words that make the email look like spam or like
a [suspicious
email](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/email-hardening/detecting-socially-engineered-messages?ref=search).

A subject in a letter is like a subject line in an email. It’s what the
recipient will read first and must make the purpose of the letter very clear.

Keep it short but informative.

<example>

#### Write

Melbourne meeting – June 2020 – proposed agenda</example>

### Use a salutation and sign-off to match the formality

The salutation and sign off should match the level of formality.

The most formal salutations are rarely useful. It is best to address a person by
their name and preferred title.

The first email in a conversation should include the recipient’s name and an
appropriate salutation. Use ‘Dear’ in a more formal context and ‘Hi’ in a more
informal context, such as emailing a colleague.

If you don’t know the recipient for an email or letter, use ‘Dear’, the
recipient’s title (Ms, Mr, Mrs, Mx, Dr) and their last name.

Use the correct and preferred title for [people of different gender
identities](/node/64). ‘Mx’ refers to non-binary people and those who do not
wish to be referred to by their gender. Use ‘Mx’ when a person indicates this is
what they prefer, but not otherwise.

If you do not know the recipient’s preferred title, you can simply use [a
person’s given name with their family
name](/node/59##use_the_terms_given_name_and_family_name).

Follow specific conventions when [addressing ministers, royalty, diplomats and
other officials](/node/149).

Be careful of using a shortened name if you aren’t sure the recipient uses it.

At the end of the letter or email, include a sign-off that matches the
salutation. Use ‘Yours sincerely’ if you know the person’s name. Use ‘Yours
faithfully’ if you do not.

Examples of salutations and sign-offs, informal to formalSalutationSign-offHi LucaHi there LucaHi LuRegardsKind regardsThanksSee you soonLet's catch upCheersDear MeenakshiRegardsKind regardsDear Ms/Mr/Mx ChanYours sincerelyTo whom it may concernDear Sir/MadamYours faithfully

### Structure the body to help the user

Plan what you are going to write. Think about:

* who the email or letter is for (the recipient)
* why you’re sending it.

Stay on topic and write only what the recipient needs to know. For emails, send
separate emails about separate topics. It helps keep the conversation clear. It
also helps the recipient find the information later.

Use one idea per [paragraph](/node/53). If it will make the email or letter
clearer, use [headings](/node/51).

Structure emails and letters so that the recipient knows what’s most important
as soon as they open it. Keep the email or letter as short as possible. People
will be able to read and understand it quickly if you omit unnecessary detail.

The body of an email should reflect the subject line. It should tell the
recipient:

* why you’re sending the email
* what they need to do or understand.

The body of a letter is where you give more details about the subject. Include:

* an introduction stating why you’re sending the letter
* what the recipient needs to do or understand
* any information the recipient needs to know so they can do what you have asked them to
* a list of extra pages, such as a form
* a concluding sentence or paragraph.

Attach only documents that are relevant to the email or letter.

If you include links in emails or electronic letters, make sure they’re
accessible and check they work. Do not use URLs in emails or letters. Link a
word or phrase so the reader is clear about where the link will take them.

Check your organisation’s policy about links in emails and electronic letters.
They can look suspicious to people receiving them.

#### Print considerations

Spell out the full URL of any links you use in a letter. This makes it easier
for the recipient to type the URL into their web browser.

If a letter is longer than one page, insert the page breaks in appropriate
places so the recipient doesn't miss information.

Never use an emoji in formal correspondence. Use emojis only when you’re sure
they are appropriate, and don’t rely on them for meaning.

### Include your signature block

Every email should include a signature block with information about the sender
and their organisation. This could be you or the person or team responsible for
the email.

Follow your agency’s requirements, which may include your:

* name
* position or role
* branch and division
* organisation
* work phone number
* work email address.

In a letter, when appropriate, add the details of a contact person if there is
one. Never include someone’s contact details if you haven’t asked first.

### Check for style and writing errors

Use the organisation’s style guide or template.

Check the letter or email before sending it, even if it’s a quick email to a
colleague. A typographical error (‘typo’) can mean the recipient has to reply
with questions instead of knowing what to do.

### Follow your organisation’s rules for archiving

Follow your workplace’s guidelines for record keeping and managing security.

#### Information management requirements

You must use the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) when preparing
government information. The PSPF covers how information is classified and
marked, and what this means for its storage, handling, access and disposal.
Consult the [PSPF’s guide to sensitive and classified
information](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/information/sensitive-classified-information/Pages/default.aspx) or
consult your organisation’s protective security policy.

Information (including emails and letters) that you create become records.
Records provide evidence of what your organisation has done and why.

Managing and disposing of records properly is a requirement under the [Archives
Act 1983](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796). You must follow
your organisation’s information management requirements. Visit the National
Archives of Australia website for [information management
standards](https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/information-management-standards).

## Forms

This guidance helps you to design digital forms filled in by the user. Most of
the guidance also applies to printed forms, but there are some differences
noted.

### Learn about the user before you design a form

Find out about users and their needs through [user research](/node/76).
Understand the user and their needs before you design any kind of form
(web-based or print).

People use forms to access a service and to meet government requirements.

Sometimes a user will need to fill in a form on behalf of another user. Or
a public servant might use a form to record what the user tells them (for
example, a statistical survey).

Before you digitise a paper form, make sure you understand the user and business
needs. Work out if a form is even needed.

#### Find out about language users can relate to

Discover the terms and phrases that people use when they talk about the topic.
This includes the words they use in search engines.

Learn about which words will help the user understand the form.

#### Develop the ‘question protocol’ first

A ‘question protocol’ is a document that helps you find out what you need to ask
the user. It lists:

* the questions you will ask
* why you are collecting information
* what you will do with it.

This document makes it easier to collect the information that is actually
needed.

A question protocol also gives you a way to challenge and push back against
unnecessary questions. Every time we ask a user for information it costs them
and your organisation. It takes time and effort for the user to provide it, and
for your organisation to manage it.

Every question protocol is different, but it should answer all the following
questions.

Work out what information you need to collect.

* Do you actually need the information? Why?
* How much detail do you need?
* Can you get the information from somewhere else? (For example, it might already be collected in your organisation.)

Explore the experience of the user providing the information.

* Which users need to give you the information?
* How will the user discover or receive the form?
* Will the user need to collect information from other people? (For example, a form can need different people to contribute to it.)
* What happens to the user before and after they give you the information?
* Are there other times you might be collecting related information?

Plan how you will manage the information you will collect.

* How will you check the information is accurate?
* What happens if you get the wrong response? What error messages will you need to provide?
* What will you do with the information when you have it?
* How will you keep the information up to date and secure?

Some of these answers won’t inform the design of the form, but will help you
manage the information.

#### Information management requirements

Your question protocol becomes a record. So does anything you collect from a
form. Records provide evidence of what your organisation has done and why.

Managing and disposing of records properly is a requirement under the [Archives
Act 1983](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796). For guidance, read
about the National Archives of Australia’s [information management
standards](https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/information-management-standards).

### Start with one thing per page then test if you need to group

Putting one thing on each page helps you see everything you need to find out,
without guessing about the best way to group it.

Begin prototyping with one thing per page over any number of pages:

* one piece of information you’re telling a user
* one decision the user has to make
* one question the user has to answer.

Each question might have more than one field. An address is one thing that would
use several fields.

<example> 
         One question (one thing): the user’s birth date 

[In a digital form you you would usually ask this question using 3 fields.]

</example>
Having a single thing on each page helps you:

* reduce the cognitive load for users
* save the user’s answers as they move through the form
* capture analytics about each question
* handle branching questions and loops.

Your research with users will help you decide what order to put the questions
in. This should include thinking about which topics are more related to each
other, or need to be answered by a particular user.

This will help you work out if you need to group questions and create sections.

You might find that you do not need to group any questions.

Keep prototyping and testing the structure of the questions until the user can:

* understand what you’re asking them to do
* focus on the specific question and its answer
* find their way through an unfamiliar process
* use the service on a mobile device.

<example> 
         A group of 2 fields in a website login  [Users often prefer to have username and password questions on the same page.]</example>

#### Avoid using a progress indicator

If the form is short (for example, 5 questions or fewer with no branching), the
user won’t need a progress indicator. Adding the indicator would be extra work
that the user might not even notice.

It’s difficult to design an accurate indicator that shows a user their progress
through a complex form.

Complex forms can branch. They might have sections that don’t apply to some
users and optional questions. This means the user might not move through the
form in a predictable way.

#### Test adding task list and ‘check your answers’ pages to complex forms

If you need to help the user estimate how long it will take to fill in a complex
form, test adding:

* a task list page at the start
* a ‘check your answers’ page at the end.

Task list pages help users understand the tasks in a transaction and their
order.

These pages show the user the tasks they have completed and help them to jump to
incomplete tasks.

<example> 
        </example>

A ‘check your answers’ page summarises the sections of a form. The summary shows
the user what information they’ve provided.

This step can help users go back and change any responses, or confirm that
they’re giving the correct information.

<example> 
         The GOV.UK Design System includes a [check your answers pattern](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/check-answers/)  </example>

### Write clear questions and headings

When you know how to group the questions, you will be able to create the
structure.

Organise content in the form using section headings. Describe the topic or the
following section in the headings.

Write short active content for forms, including ‘help text’ and error messages –
this is called ‘microcopy’.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
* I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.

Fundamentals:

Follow the guidance to write clear questions and headings.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [2.4.6 Headings and labels – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=248##headings-and-labels)
* [2.4.10 Section headings – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=248##section-headings)
* [3.3.2 Labels or instructions – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=248##labels-or-instructions)
* [3.3.6. Error prevention (all) – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##error-prevention-all)

#### Use familiar words in familiar ways

Write and design forms starting with [plain
language](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/node/194). Include the terms that are
familiar to users.

A form can be harder for people to find and use if it does not contain the terms
people expect to be there. Your research with users will identify the terms
people use about the topic.

Test the form with the terms included. If they help the user understand and use
the form, keep them.

If some users don’t understand the terms, include plain language definitions.

Establish the appropriate [voice and tone](/node/40).

#### Say who the form is for and what they need

Before a user starts a form, they need to know:

* what the form is for and if they need to fill it in
* who can use the form (if they are eligible for the service)
* what they need to submit the form (for example, tax file number and passport number)
* if they can ask someone else to fill it in for them
* what happens after they submit it and any other stages.

If the form is part of a service that will involve other stages, show the full
service process with a task list. Include information about any other forms the
user will need to fill in.

#### Don’t mark ‘required’ questions – only ask for what you need

You must only collect personal information if it is necessary. Collect the least
amount needed for the function or activity related to the form.

Tell people when and why you are collecting their personal information, and what
their privacy rights are. Use a collection statement on the form.

You don’t need to mark questions as ‘required’ because you will only be asking
for information that is needed.

Sometimes you need to invite the user to tell you something they think is
important and they want us to know (for example, to collect feedback).
Mark these questions as ‘optional’.

##### Privacy requirements and access to information

​

When you handle personal information, you must comply with the [Australian
Privacy
Principles](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/).
Personal information is any information that could identify an individual, in
any format.

People have a right to request access to their personal information under the
[Privacy Act 1988](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/).

People also have the right to request access to government-held information
under the [Freedom of Information Act
1982](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02562). This includes personal
information collected in a form.

The federal regulator for privacy and freedom of information legislation is
the [Office of the Australian Information
Commissioner](https://www.oaic.gov.au/).

#### Keep a single column format

Don’t use multiple columns in digital forms.

##### Print considerations

Avoid using a second column in print forms.

If you have to use multiple columns, keep the same number throughout the form.

Make sure the columns are visually different (for example, with a thick line
between them).

Splitting information across 2 or more columns can:

* add cognitive load for users
* slow down users of assistive technology if they miss content
* make the form harder to use on mobile devices.

#### Number the questions

For forms that have more than one question, number the questions.

This is helpful for the user if they need to leave the form and return to it
later. It can also make it easier for them to get help to fill it in, and for
them to work across a paper and digital version.

### Choose accessible form inputs

Use the following 3 form inputs. They are the most accessible for users.

If you need the user to:

* pick one preferred option, use radio buttons
* select one or more options, use checkboxes
* write an answer, use a text input (including for numbers).

If you need to use other form inputs, try rewriting the questions to fit these
inputs.

<example> 
#### Radio buttons

       A choice of one preferred option  </example>

 <example> 
#### Checkboxes

       A choice of one or more options  </example>

 <example> 
#### Text inputs

       Text inputs for a postcode, mobile number and address  </example>

Set the size of the text input box to the size of the response the user will
provide. Your research will help you work out the right field size.

#### Print considerations

There is no way for a user to distinguish between radio buttons and check boxes
in print forms. You can include a message to select only one option, but the
user might not read this.

Plan for how you will use the information if the user selects more than one
option.

Don’t disable inputs as it can confuse the user. Only include a question if it
is relevant to the user.

#### Avoid using select (menu items) and range sliders

Select boxes and range sliders can be very hard for some people to use. This
includes people who experience essential tremor or difficulties with hand
control.

Instead of using a select box, ask other questions to reduce options. Then
display fewer options using radio buttons.

<example> 
         Radio buttons  </example>

Use radio buttons instead of range sliders.

<example> 
         Radio buttons  </example>

#### Use buttons for calls to action

Buttons in forms help users carry out an action like submitting or saving a
form.

Don’t use a button unless it is a call for action.

The label must clearly describe what happens when the user selects the
button. Try to use one word or a short phrase as a label. Avoid using icons or
images.

##### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
* I can predict the webpage's appearance and how I will operate the content.
* I can operate the webpage with something other than a keyboard, like a pointer.
* I can avoid making any mistakes with my inputs, and correct any that I might make.

Fundamentals:

Follow the guidance to use buttons for calls to action.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [2.4.6 Headings and labels – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=248##headings-and-labels)
* [3.3.2 Labels or instructions – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=248##labels-or-instructions)
* [2.5.3 Label in name – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=248##label-in-name)
* [1.3.5 Identify input purpose – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=248##identify-input-purpose)

#### Use the primary button for the main action

Use a button for the main call to action on the form (for example, ‘Save and
next’ or ‘Send application’).

Position the primary action button in the same place on every page (for example,
at the bottom of the form, aligned with the left side of the input field). This
placement makes the form predictable and easier to use.

<example> 
         A primary button  </example>

#### Add secondary buttons if there are extra actions

Sometimes you need to use a secondary button for another common action (for
example, ‘Save as draft’). Make sure the button action matches what it says it
does.

Make secondary buttons visually different and less prominent than the primary
button.

<example> 
         A primary button and a secondary button  </example>

#### Avoid using a disabled button

Disabled buttons can confuse some users. Only include them when your research
shows they make the form easier for the user.

#### Write labels for every question

Include one short label for every form question to make it clear to the user
what to do. The label is the text that appears near a form question.

Write labels without a colon at the end. Otherwise, follow the normal rules for
using [punctuation marks](/node/119).

Don’t put anything in the field the user will type in – this is called
‘placeholder text’. Placeholder text disappears when a person clicks in the
field and is usually of very low contrast.

Write clear labels and ‘help text’ instead of placeholder text.

<example> 
         Label for a text input (‘Email’)         Label for radio buttons (‘Location’)  </example>

#### Make sure labels are close to their question

Align most labels above and close to the questions.

For numerical fields, place the measurement symbol on the usual side it would be
written. For example, put ‘$’ on the left side of the field and ‘%’ on the right
side of the field.

Position checkboxes and radio buttons to the left of the label.

#### Use <label> or <legend> for digital form headings

If you have one question per page, use that question as the heading for the
page.

Put the <label> or <legend> element inside the <h1> element.

This avoids screen readers reading out the same information twice.

<example> 
##### Example

         Create password question 

[The question label is also the <H1> heading on this page.]

</example>

#### Include ‘help text’ to provide more context

Write extra text to help the user complete the question the first time they try.
This is called ‘help text’ or ‘hint text’.

In very complex forms, you might need to link to more detailed explanation.

Don’t use ‘tooltips’ to provide help. A tooltip is extra information that
appears when the user hovers over an item. It is difficult to design tooltips
that everyone can access.

Position the help text between the label and the input field. Don’t use
headings, labels or placeholder text for help text.

Associate the help text with the label for screen reader users.

<example> 
##### Example

         Help text for entering a tax file number  </example>

#### Use prefilled information and default options if appropriate for the user

If it’s appropriate and secure, prefill information. This saves the user time
and effort. Research with users to make sure they’re comfortable with
prefilling.

Present prefilled information on its own page. Ask the user to check and correct
the information as part of the form page.

Never include pre-selected gender or sex options.

<example> 
##### Example

         A request to check contact details  </example>

If users are not asked to confirm details they might miss them.

<example> 
         A question about how useful the page is without a default option  </example>

#### Add validation to help the user to complete digital forms

A form with validation will check what the user types into fields. It will
trigger an error message for the user if they miss a field or make a mistake.

Write error messages so they help the user act on the problem. Do not blame them
for making a mistake.

<example> 
         A helpful error message  </example>

Apply verification checks for:

* correct numbers of digits – for example, a phone number
* including a required character – for example, the ‘@’ in email addresses.

You can help some users complete the form by adding colour to show if an input
is valid. Don’t use colour alone, and make sure assistive technology can detect
validation.

If the user is not eligible for a service, don’t show a validation error. Use a
separate page that explains:

* why they can’t use the service
* their options.

##### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

I have confidence the markup language supports my use of software and assistive
technology to access the content.

Fundamentals:

Follow the guidance to add validation to help the user to complete the digital
forms.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [4.1.3 Status messages – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=248##status-messages)
* [3.3.1 Error identification – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=248##error-identification)
* [3.3.3 Error suggestion – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=248##error-suggestion)
* [3.3.5 Help – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=248##help)
* [3.3.6 Error prevention (all) – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##error-prevention-all)

#### Help the user save and resume complex digital forms

Include a button for the user to save a draft as they work through complex
forms. The form should reopen to the page they were on.

Display a receipt code when the user submits the form.

#### Add only essential branding
Talk to your communications team for guidelines on how to brand forms.

Make sure print and digital forms meet the [Australian Government branding
guidelines](https://www.pmc.gov.au/resource-centre/government/australian-government-branding-guidelines-use-australian-government-logo-australian-government-departments-and-agencies).

Only include icons, images or colour when research shows they help the user
understand the form. Make sure you create [accessible images](/node/46).

## Images

Images can help users if they are clear and simple. Make sure everyone can
access the information that images convey.

### Add images only if they help the user

Use images if they help users complete their task with your service or
product. Images can make it easier for some people to understand information.

Types of images include:

* photographs and decorative images
* charts, graphs and maps
* diagrams
* drawings
* icons.

#### Copyright requirements

You must get permission (a licence) to use copyright material. This includes
images and text.

Some images are available under an open access licence, such as [Creative
Commons](https://creativecommons.org.au/). Alt text is also licensed under
copyright.

Read the government copyright rules in the [Australian Government intellectual
property
manual](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

#### Choose diverse images that are clear and simple

Choose images that reflect and support the diversity of Australia’s peoples and
cultures, especially if you are using images of people.

Keep images simple and use them to support information in the text.

Images must be:

* accessible
* easy to understand
* relevant
* uncluttered
* from a credible source
* consistent in design and style across the content.

Use the same font and typeface, line thickness and colour scheme in all images
of the same type.

#### Include decorative images only if they are relevant to the content

Decorative images, such as photographs, can show an idea and make content more
visually attractive.

Don’t use images to fill in space. Decorative images must still be relevant. Use
images that relate directly to the content.

People will identify and dismiss stock images that don’t seem genuine.

### Use alt text, captions and titles to explain images

Follow the guidance on adding [alt text, captions and titles](/node/49).

Add alt text to all images.

Include captions for all images that are not decorative. Add titles to help
users scan content.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can understand any information contained in an image.
* I can easily control how I see and hear distinctions if colour or sound convey meaning.

Fundamentals:

* Include images on a page only if they meet a real user need.
* Understand the purpose of the image to write [alt text](/node/49).
* Use real text rather than images of text whenever technically possible. (Logos can be an exception.)
* Make sure that colour is not the only visual means of conveying information in graphs and diagrams. Text labels and patterns can supplement the use of colour. Make sure the contrast is sufficient for all users.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [1.1.1 Non-text content – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##non-text-content)
* [1.4.2 Contrast (minimum) – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##contrast-minimum)
* [1.4.6 Contrast (enhanced) – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##contrast-enhanced)
* [1.4.11 Non-text contrast – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##non-text-contrast)
* [1.4.9 Images of text (no exception) – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##images-of-text-no-exception)
* [1.4.5 Images of text – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##images-of-text)
* [1.4.1 Use of colour – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##use-of-color)

### Set the correct resolution and file type

Image resolution must be appropriate for the content.

Don’t embed images with a large file size into content that you will publish
online, such as PDFs or webpages. Optimise and compress all image files so they
make it quicker for the user to access the information.

Design for mobile devices first. An image will scale to the device people view
it on. Check that it’s easy to read on a mobile phone screen and a desktop.

There are many file types for images. Seek specialist advice to optimise an
image file as a vector or raster file format.

### Use graphs, charts and maps if they explain complex information

Use graphs, charts and maps for information that is too detailed for the text.
Don’t use them if another format meets the user need – such as a list, table or
tool.

Graphs and charts display data, making it easier to understand. They are good
for showing:

* trends – such as change over time
* statistical distributions and patterns
* simple comparisons – such as totals for different categories or different rates of change
* processes and relationships – such as an organisational structure or a workflow chart.

To make it easier for people to use line graphs and bar charts:

* Don’t add borders or background tints.
* Use gridlines only where they help people read the data.
* Use ‘tick marks’ on the x- and y-axes to show the scale of data intervals at a glance. Avoid more than 10 tick marks on the y-axis.
* Scale the y-axis to be consistent across the viewport or page.
* Keep it simple (for example, include no more than 3 or 4 data series on a line graph).
* Don’t use colour as the only source of meaning. Try adding dots and dashes to lines and cross hatching to areas.

#### Add legends and units of measurement to complex images

All graphs, charts and maps should have a legend that tells people the meaning
of lines, colours and symbols.

Make legends consistent in a webpage or group of webpages dealing with the same
topic. Place the legend in the same position (for example, bottom centre, top
left or to the right).

Use the same font and typeface, and colours and symbols for the same types of
information.

Maps must also have a scale bar and an arrow to show which way is north.

Include all [units of measurement](/node/147). This helps people understand what
the numbers mean.

* Label the x- and y-axes, as well as legends, titles and captions as relevant.
* Use appropriate units (for example, millions of dollars for a company balance sheet but thousands of dollars for a household budget).
* Use the appropriate number of decimal places on labels (for example, $1,000 – not $1,000.00 – for a scale of zero to $10,000).

#### Refer to informational images in the text

Refer to complex images in the body of the text. It helps people relate the
discussion in the text to the information displayed in the image.

Place the image close to where you mention it in the text. For example, a graph
must be on the same page and after the paragraph that refers to it.

Don’t repeat the whole [caption of the image](/node/49) in the text. Instead,
use a locator number to refer to it, for example ‘Figure 1’.

Don’t refer to ‘the photograph on the left’. This sensory language is not
accessible for some users.

You don’t need to refer to decorative images and illustrations in the text
unless they are part of the discussion.

<example>
Figure 6 shows an example of good ergonomic posture.</example>

Ensure your text comments on or interprets the image, rather than repeating the
text or data in it.

<example>
European Union expenditure more than quadrupled from 2016 to 2018 (Figure 7).</example>

Check any details that feature in both the text and an image. For example, the
text might quote numbers from a graph. It is easy to make a last-minute change
to one and forget to correct the other.

##### Print considerations

Avoid referring to a page number in the text because page numbers can change
during the publishing process.

### Follow the correct order for image notes

Image notes appear below an image. Notes can apply to the whole image or to one
element of the image.

List notes in the following order:

1. abbreviations
2. notes to superscript locators (such as a superscript ‘##’, ‘a’ or ‘1’)
3. general note to the image
4. source of data (use the appropriate form for [author–date](/node/165) or [documentary–note](/node/166)).

Don’t include this information in the caption or in ordinary footnotes or
endnotes.

Align notes to the left. They should not extend beyond the edges of the image.

## Alt text, captions and titles for images

Alternative text explains information in images for screen reader users.
Captions describe images to help users relate them to surrounding text. Titles
identify images and number them in long-form content.

### Give all users access to the same information

When people use content with images, they get information from different
elements.

Users combine information from:

* image captions and titles
* body text and the images themselves
* alt text.

These elements have different purposes.

* Titles help identify specific images (for example, ‘Figure 1’) – particularly if they are listed or referenced in other parts of the content. They are different from the [HTML title attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_title.asp).
* Captions are brief descriptions related to the image (for example commentary, attributions or quotations).
* Alternative text (alt text) is a short description of the information an image conveys. It’s either available to the user as an HTML attribute or through a document’s accessibility tool. Alt text is not usually visible on the page.

An extended description is alternative text that explains a complex image. It is
visible either on the same page or on a separate page. You might write an
extended description for a chart or process, for example.

<example>
Users are at the centre of the content lifecycle. The cycle starts with intent.
It then moves through 6 stages: discover needs; draft; test; approve; publish;
maintain. The process is circular. The cycle shows continuous improvement
through repetition. Stages can repeat before completing a full cycle.</example>

Don’t:

* hide information in the alt text, as a user might not see it
* repeat information in the alt text that a user would read in the caption
* use the <longdesc> attribute for extended descriptions.

### Add alt text to all images

Include short alt text – less than about 100 characters – for all informative
images. Decorative images should have null alt text (alt="").

Users need images to have alt text for different purposes.

* Screen readers read out alt text to tell a user what’s in it and why it’s there.
* Browsers and mobile devices display alt text to tell a user with a slow internet connection or limited data about an image that isn’t displayed.
* Search engines use alt text to index images to make it easier for a user to find information.

#### Accessibility requirements

User need:

I can understand any information contained in an image.

Fundamentals:

* Add alternative text for all images. For help with writing good alt text: the W3C [alt decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/).
* Write alternative text that describes the information or function of the image. For help to describe images: the W3C/WAI [Web Accessibility Tutorials - Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/).

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criterion:[1.1.1 Non-text content –
level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##non-text-content).

### Include captions for all images that are not decorative

Add captions for all images, unless they are only decorative.

Use captions to acknowledge the creator or copyright holder of images in
captions. Use your organisation’s [referencing style](/node/181).

Include the HTML <figcaption> element to associate the caption with the image.

<example>
<figure><figcaption>Figure 3: Kangaroo numbers in Victoria from 1880 to
1980</figcaption><img src="kangaroo.svg" alt= "Line graph showing a doubling of
kangaroo numbers from 1880 to 1980">... </figure></example>

For more instructions about using figure captions, visit [Web Accessibility
Tutorials – complex images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/complex/).

#### Copyright requirements

When referencing, you must [attribute copyright material](/node/181). This
includes images and text.

Write the attribution as part of the caption or following the copyright
material. Alt text is also licensed under copyright.

Read the government copyright rules in the [Australian Government intellectual
property
manual](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

### Write alt text and captions to support the image’s purpose

The detail you need to include in alt text, captions and titles depends on the
reason you have included the image.

* Decorative images add visual interest but not information (for example, the background pattern on a website).
* Informative images convey simple concepts or information (for example, how to open a medication bottle).
* Functional images are part of interactions and don’t convey information (for example, Australian Government branding that links to a home page).

#### Decorative images

Include an empty value, or null text, for alt text if the image is decorative.
This is 2 double quotation marks with no space (alt=""). In documents, set
images as ‘Decorative image’ or ‘Background image’. The empty value tells screen
readers to ignore the image.

An image is decorative if you can remove it from the page without losing any
meaning or information.

Include keywords in the surrounding text to support search engines. Don’t create
alt text to add keywords.

#### Informational images

Write alt text that conveys the same important information as the image.

Don’t write something in the alt text that a user can’t learn from seeing the
image or reading the caption or title.

Add captions and titles that give context.

Don’t repeat the information provided by the image and alt text. This prevents
users of screen readers from hearing the same information twice.

If the caption or nearby text already explains the informational image, you
might use very brief alt text.

Examples of informative images that might have an empty value in the alt text
include:

* a photograph with a caption that is a full description of the content and function of the photograph
* a snapshot of a software screen that the text describes
* an illustration of an idea that the text describes.

In these cases, the images give visual learners another way to access
information in the text. You could remove the image without losing the meaning,
but this might disadvantage users who need a visual explanation.

<example>
       You might use alt="Screenshot of dropdown menu and buttons" if the nearby ​​​​text (for example, the caption) had this instruction:Select the ‘save’ button between the ‘Tools’ drop-down and the ‘Cancel’ button </example>

#### Logos

Write the full name of the organisation in the logo alt text.

For logos that are functional links to home pages, use the name of the site in
the link instead of the alt text. You don’t need to add the name to the link if
it is already in the text on the page.

#### Icons

Write different alt text for decorative, informative or functional icons.

* Use empty alt text (alt="") to declare it as decorative.
* Describe the informational icon so the user can understand what it is.
* State the functional icon’s purpose so the user can understand the outcome.

<example>
       A decorative printer icon: alt="" An informational printer icon: alt="Printer icon" A functional printer icon: alt="Print this page" </example>

#### Complex images

Complex images contain too much information to include in the alt text alone.

To make sure people can access the information include:

* alt text that contains a brief interpretation of the main idea from the image
* a caption that summarises the image
* an extended description with more details about the data in the image, usually referencing the title or caption of the image.

Link in-text references to the image title only if it helps the user.

Write the extended description on the same page or, if it is very long, link to
it on a separate page. Do not use the <longdesc> attribute.

Use the extended description to help the user understand the information in the
image. Put most of the interpretation of the image in the body text. If the
image is a graph, you might link to a table of data.

Extended descriptions usually include:

* what is being measured (the axis labels) and the units of measurements
* the range of data – the maximum and minimum or first and last
* the average or other statistics
* a description of the trend in the data – increasing or decreasing
* comparisons between data sets, such as ‘more than’, ‘relative’ or ‘inverse’.

For examples of alt text, visit Benetech Initiative’s [General image description
guidelines](http://diagramcenter.org/table-of-contents-2.html##contents). They
also have examples of maps, diagrams, complex images and [extended descriptions
for graphs](http://diagramcenter.org/specific-guidelines-e.html).

#### Photographs and illustrations

Include alt text and captions for all informative photographs and illustrations.
The information you provide depends on the content format.

<example>
This image could have a different caption and alt text, depending on the content
format.

An environmental committee report might include a list of species with a photo
and links to management plans. This is a functional image that serves as a link.

* Caption for committee report: Hoary sunray (Leucochysum albicans) (caption is hyperlinked)
* Alt text for committee report: alt=""

An agency visitor centre might publish a guide to the Snowy Mountains.

* Caption for visitor guide: These beautiful flowers (Hoary sunray) decorate the Snowy Mountains in summer
* Alt text for visitor guide: alt="Photograph of flower growing in rocky ground"

An annual report might include a section about the plants of the Snowy
Mountains. The caption describes the image, so the alt text is null.

* Caption for annual report: The Hoary sunray has paper-like white flowers and thrives in the harsh rocky ground on Mount Townsend in summer
* Alt text for annual report: alt=""</example>

### Use consistent formatting and punctuation for captions and titles

Align captions and titles to the left. Place captions for decorative images,
such as photographs, below the image.

Titles and captions don’t need to be a complete sentence. Other grammar and
punctuation rules for titles and captions are:

* Capitalise the first word and proper nouns only.
* Don’t use a full stop to end the title or caption, even if it is a complete sentence.

All titles and captions should have the same:

* structure (parallel structure)
* terms and shortened forms as those used in the rest of the content (such as [acronyms](/node/190))
* font and typeface.

#### Print considerations

In print, the placement of captions for images is a design consideration.
Consult your organisation’s visual style guide to find out what you need to do.

Don’t extend titles or captions beyond the edges of image.

### Number titles in long documents

Many publications refer to all images as ‘figures’. Complex publications with
many images can use different categories (such as figures, maps or photographs).

In long-form content, number titles that go with images using ‘figure labels’.
You don’t need to number images in a brochure, an infographic or a simple,
stand-alone page with only a few images.

The purpose of numbering images is to help people find a specific image. Put the
number before the main text of the image title.

To number an image title in a long document:

* Use the ‘Insert caption’ function in applications to create a label.
* Select the ‘Figure’ label option, and the option to position the label above the image.
* Do not select the ‘Exclude label from caption’ box.

The labels will convert to titles that are automatically numbered and styled for
you. Check that you:

* start the numbering at the beginning of the document
* use a colon after the number to separate it from the title text
* use an initial capital for title text that comes after the colon.

Some disciplines use a full stop after the number. If your organisation uses
this style, apply it consistently.

Use the ‘Cross-reference’ function to insert the reference in the body text of
the document. Select ‘Only label and number’ so you don’t include the entire
title, only the figure label (for example, ‘Figure 1’).

These functions keep track of numbering for you. If you move images around in
the document, the numbering updates the cross-references you create to their
titles in the body text.

Number images separately from any numbered [tables](/node/45).

<example>
Table 1: Risk assessment thresholds for Green Trees National Park

Figure 1: Visitor numbers to the Green Trees main walk, 2008 to 2019

Figure 2: Traffic accident rates at Green Trees Weir, 2009 to 2010

Table 2: Visitor numbers during March to October 2019</example>

## Journals, magazines and newspapers

Journals, magazines and newspapers are known as ‘periodicals’. Periodicals are
published at regular intervals, so they are sometimes called ‘serials’. Number
each issue of a serial and include other publication information so people can
find it.

### Include all parts of the periodical

Periodicals get published at regular times. Each issue of a periodical is
complete but also part of a set or volume. Most periodicals are online. Some no
longer have a print version.

Because each issue is complete in itself, you must include the following:

* title
* year, volume and issue number
* name of the sponsoring body
* name of the publisher or distributor or both
* copyright details
* restrictions on circulation
* International Standard Serial Number (ISSN).

#### Add more details for journals

Journals are periodicals used to present research findings or industry
knowledge. The audience includes specialists or people with an interest in the
field. It is common for journals to peer-review research before publication.

As well as the parts listed for periodicals, it is usual for each article in a
journal to have:

* the title and author details
* an abstract
* references as footnotes, endnotes or a list of references
* a document object identifier (DOI)
* extra material useful for the content.

### Consider accessible formats

Online periodicals often have their own websites. The home page should have:

* the periodical’s branding and contact details
* the names of the editors
* the aim of the periodical
* information for authors on how to submit articles
* details on how to subscribe.

Each online issue of a periodical usually has a landing page and a series of
articles.

Consider using EPUB, which is an accessible eBook format that users can read on
mobile devices. You can convert Microsoft Word files to EPUB format using the
[WordToEPUB tool](https://daisy.org/activities/software/wordtoepub/).

If there is a strong user need to provide a PDF (for example for printing), the
document must still be accessible.

Printed periodicals and periodicals published online as PDF have covers. If the
periodical shows page numbers, use odd numbers for the right-hand pages.

#### Accessibility considerations

User needs:

For a comprehensive list, refer to the [overview on accessibility](/node/218).

You must make all government content accessible to people with disability. This
is part of Australian law under the [Disability Discrimination Act
1992](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04426).

* [Accessibility for Adobe InDesign – Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/indesign.html)

#### Copyright and legal deposit requirements

You must choose a licence to release copyright materials. If you work in
government, use an open access licence if you can (for example, [Creative
Commons](https://creativecommons.org.au/)).

Read the government copyright rules in the [Australian Government intellectual
property
manual](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

The National Library of Australia collects Australian publications under
the [Copyright Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C1968A00063).
Your agency is obliged to contribute publications through legal deposit. Find
out more [about legal deposit on the National Library
website](https://www.nla.gov.au/legal-deposit). This information covers online
annual reports, which are serials.

### Group issues into volumes

Both digital and print periodicals can group issues into volumes. There’s
usually a volume for each calendar year. Each volume has its own title page,
contents list and index.

In print and PDF periodicals, start each new volume at page 1. Number the pages
of the issues so they continue from one issue to the next, throughout the
volume.

#### Separate covers

Some online journals have the cover and publishing information as a separate
download. This is often called ‘front matter’. Others keep the entire issue as a
stand-alone download.

##### Print considerations

If the issue has a cover, it will be removed when the issues are put into
volumes:

* Include the title, date of issue, International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) and sponsoring body on the outside front cover of the volume.
* Repeat all of this information, except for the ISSN, on the first page with the rest of the essential information, such as copyright and any restrictions on circulation.

The first page might also contain a contents list, and the final pages might
contain an index.

#### No separate covers (newspapers and websites)

Newspapers and magazines are examples of periodicals without separate covers.
Some periodicals have a print and digital version. Others are online only.

Digital-only content is archived by date or other metadata such as topic. The
print conventions of binding and page numbers don’t apply. Archive the articles
so people can find them.

##### Print considerations

Put the publication details for each issue on the cover page. Include:

* the title
* the publishing date
* the sponsoring body
* the volume and part number (if any).

Put this extra information on page 2 (with the contents list) or the back page:

* the name of the printer, publisher, distributor or agent
* the editorial address
* subscription rates.

Start each issue of a periodical without a separate cover from page 1. Include
the title, date and page number at the top or bottom of the page.

##### Information management requirements

Articles, journals and other serials that you create for the Australian
Government become records. Records provide evidence of what your organisation
has done and why.

Managing and disposing of records properly is a requirement under the [Archives
Act 1983](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796). You must follow
your organisation’s information management requirements. Visit the National
Archives of Australia website for [information management
standards](https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/information-management-standards).

### Apply for identifying numbers for your periodical

The National Library of Australia has information about how to [apply for
identifying numbers for your
periodical](https://www.nla.gov.au/content/apply-for-an-isbn-issn-or-ismn).

Identifying numbers are a unique way to locate the work. They include:

* International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs)
* International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSNs), if the periodical is part of a series.

ISSNs are a unique way to locate the work. Use separate ISSNs for a digital
periodical and a print periodical, even if they look the same.

For digital-only content, you must publish 5 articles before you can apply for
an ISSN.

Your periodical may also be eligible for a cataloguing statement approved by the
National Library’s [Prepublication Data
Service](https://www.nla.gov.au/content/prepublication-data-service).

### Explain how to access datasets and extra material

Periodicals can include material that is useful but too detailed to have in the
text. To include it would interrupt the flow of reading.

In digital periodicals, material includes:

* audio and video
* code
* datasets.

Both printed and digital periodicals must tell their users how to access extra
material. Online periodicals use a hyperlink in most cases. Printed periodicals
need to tell people how to access this material if it is not in the appendices.

The United States National Information Standards Organization has [recommended
practices for online supplemental journal article
material](https://www.niso.org/publications/niso-rp-15-2013-recommended-practices-online-supplemental-journal-article-materials).

## PDF (Portable Document Format)

Only create PDFs if your research shows there are specific needs for this
format. Make PDF content accessible to everyone who needs it.

### Create webpages by default

Create content in HTML pages instead of PDFs.

You can configure HTML pages for printing and sharing.

#### Usability problems with PDFs

PDFs often create problems for users, including:

* Scalability – PDFs don't reflow to fit the user's screen or browser windows.
* Speed – PDF files are much larger than optimised HTML pages. They can be harder to use by people with slow internet access.
* Navigation – you can't link from a page to a section of a PDF. PDFs can also cause disorientation when they open in a new tab or different tool.
* Search engine optimisation – very often PDFs aren't tagged. This makes it hard for search engines to find the content.
* Maintenance – people download and share PDFs, making it hard for you to ensure that people are using up-to-date content.

#### Accessibility considerations

User needs:

* I can access the content in the format I need.
* I can change the content’s presentation without losing information or structure.

For a comprehensive list, refer to the [overview on accessibility](/node/218).

PDFs often create challenges for people using assistive technologies, including
text to voice. These technologies often can't use PDF tagging to describe
headings and other elements. It can also be difficult to navigate complex
layouts such as 2 columns.

You must make all government content accessible to people with disability. This
is part of Australian law under the [Disability Discrimination Act
1992](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018C00125).

The Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) issues advisory notes to help you
comply with the Act. The AHRC advises that if you use PDFs, you should also
[provide the content in another format that is
accessible](https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/disability-rights/world-wide-web-access-disability-discrimination-act-advisory-notes-ver##pdf).

### Do research to find why users need a PDF

Your research could show that a HTML page doesn't meet certain user needs.
People might need to share documents with specific functionality or layout such
as a pamphlet or form.

Before using a PDF, check if other document formats will meet the need.
An example is the electronic publishing (EPUB) file format. EPUB documents scale
to the screen sizes of different mobile devices.

Don't use a Microsoft Word document if you need to protect the document from
changes after it's shared.

### Make PDF content accessible to all users

When you publish a PDF:

* provide the content in another format that is accessible
* mark up the PDF with the right tags
* check that assistive technology reads the PDF content in the correct order
* add 'PDF' and file size to [meaningful link text](/node/193/##link_to_something_only_if_it_helps_meet_the_users_need).

<example>
A useful resource for law students is [Table of abbreviations [PDF 94.35
KB]](https://support.thomsonreuters.com.au/sites/default/files/2017-09/AU-WLAU-Guide-Leg-Com-Table-of-Abbreviations.PDF)
by Thomson Reuters Australia.</example>

Guidance on creating accessible PDFs:

* [PDF techniques for WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/pdf.html)(W3C 2016)
* [FAQ and practical tips for Word and PDF accessibility](https://www.visionaustralia.org/services/digital-access/blog/27-08-2014/faq-and-practical-tips-for-word-and-pdf-accessibility) (Zumbo 2014)
* [Adobe Acrobat accessibility](https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/acrobat.html) (Adobe 2021).

There may be barriers to creating accessible formats from certain existing PDFs.
Government is not allowed to change some documents authored by independent
organisations. This includes audits and privacy impact assessments.

When there are significant barriers to providing content in another format, at
least:

* create a landing page with a high-level summary of the content
* provide a way for people to request an accessible version – for example, an email address.

## Reports

Create complete reports with a landing page, preliminary content, body and
endmatter. Include other parts if the report needs to be tabled in parliament.

### Order the parts of the report

There are conventions that apply to how the information in reports should
appear.

The basic parts of a report are:

* a landing page (a cover for printed reports)
* preliminary content (separate pages in printed reports)
* the main part of the report
* supporting information (endmatter).

The type of report will determine what to include and where.

### Consider publishing format

Most government reports are published online, either as HTML or downloadable
files. Consider user needs and compliance requirements when deciding on format.

HTML should be the default format for all government information. Some other
formats have extra functionality, for example:

* a ‘search full report’ option
* an offline reading option.

EPUB is an accessible e-book format that users can read on mobile devices. You
can convert Microsoft Word files to EPUB format using the [WordToEPUB
tool](https://daisy.org/activities/software/wordtoepub/).

There may be a user need or compliance requirement to publish a PDF or printed
report. You should also make sure the content is available in another format,
such as HTML.

#### Accessibility considerations

User needs:

For a better understanding of user needs and accessibility, refer to
the [overview on accessibility](/node/218).

You must make all government content accessible to people with disability. This
is part of Australian law under the [Disability Discrimination Act

### Check the rules for tabling reports

There are rules for presenting documents in the Australian Parliament.
Presenting documents is called ‘tabling’.

The rules are set out in the [Tabling
guidelines](https://www.pmc.gov.au/resource-centre/government/tabling-guidelines).
The guidelines apply to most documents, including:

* annual reports
* reports of royal commissions
* periodic reports required by law
* reports tabled at the initiative of the government
* treaties.

There are a few exceptions, explained in the guidelines, that are not covered by
these rules. The exceptions include reports of parliamentary committees.

#### Print considerations

The Parliament of Australia details [printing standards for documents to be
included in the Parliamentary Papers
Series](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Chamber_documents/Tabled_Papers/Advice_to_government_agencies##standards).

You must produce documents in line with parliamentary printing standards.
Electronic versions must be identical to printed versions and must be
accessible.

#### Annual reports

Australian Government annual reports must be tabled in the Australian
Parliament.

The Department of Finance has guidelines on what to include in the annual
reports of Australian Government departments and agencies.

Follow its guidance about requirements to [make sure your annual report
complies](https://www.finance.gov.au/government/managing-commonwealth-resources/planning-reporting/annual-reports).

Australian Government departments and agencies must also publish their annual
reports through the [Transparency Portal](https://www.transparency.gov.au/).
Contact the Department of Finance to get access to the tool.

##### Information management requirements

You must use the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) when preparing
government information. The PSPF covers how information is classified and
marked, and what this means for its storage, handling, access and disposal.
[Consult the PSPF
webpages](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/information/sensitive-classified-information/Pages/default.aspx) or
consult your organisation’s protective security policy.

Information (including reports) that you create for the Australian Government
become records. Records provide evidence of what your organisation has done and
why.

Managing and disposing of records properly is a requirement under the [Archives
Act 1983](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796). You must follow
your organisation’s information management requirements. Visit the National
Archives of Australia website for [information management
standards](https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/information-management-standards).

### Use the landing page or cover to identify the report

All reports have a landing page or cover (if printed). Use these to give an
overview of the report so people can decide if they want to download or read it.

The landing page or cover also shows the:

* title
* subtitle, if any
* name of the author or editor.

They may also show other details such as the date and the publisher.

#### Print considerations

In print publications:

* the inside front and back covers are often blank – they can include information from the reverse title page
* the back cover may be blank or show details that aren’t on the reverse title page.

Dust jackets protect a printed work and advertise it.

* The front shows the title and author.
* The back shows reviews, retail price if relevant, and ISBN or ISSN.
* The flaps often contain blurbs about the publication and author.
* If more than about 5 millimetres wide, the spine shows the title, author and publisher’s logo. The words always run across or down the spine.

### Include a title page and preliminary parts

There are many items you can include in preliminary content. Some are best
suited to printed publications. Judge what you need for your report.

Australian Government reports published online should include the same
information as a printed version.

A title page should include the following:

* title
* subtitle, if any
* author’s name
* name of the sponsor, if applicable.

It can also have additional details such as the name of a compiler, translator,
reviser or illustrator.

The reverse title page, or ‘imprint’ page, includes details that don’t appear on
the title page, such as:

* copyright notices, including copyright held by others such as photographers and illustrators
* the publisher’s imprint or name and address
* lists of editions and reprints
* list of other volumes in a multi-volume set (this can also be on a separate page)
* identifying numbers and library classification data
* name of others contributing to the document, such as the editor, designer or illustrator.

Many online reports put imprint page material on the splash screen or landing
page. Wherever it features, people should be able to easily find copyright and
other information about the report.

#### Print considerations

You can put information prepared for the reverse title page somewhere else such
as the inside front cover or back cover, if you’re not leaving those blank.

Printed reports can also have half-title and reverse half-title pages.

The purpose of the half-title page is to protect the title page in a printed
publication. It is not relevant for online publishing.

Conventions for a half-title page are:

* Show the main title exactly as it appears on the cover.
* Do not show any subtitles.
* Include a series title if the report is part of a series.

The reverse half-title page is often blank. It can include:

* a list of other works by the same author
* a list of other contributors
* details of the series it is part of
* details of other volumes in the set
* part of an illustration that spills over from the title page.

Check the order of the preliminary pages. Number them with lower case roman
numerals such as ’i’, ’ii’, ’iii’ and ’iv’.

#### Identifying numbers and library classification data

The National Library of Australia provides information about how to [apply for
identifying numbers for your
report](https://www.nla.gov.au/content/apply-for-an-isbn-issn-or-ismn).

Identifying numbers are a unique way to locate the work. They include:

* International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs)
* International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSNs), if the report is part of a series.

Your report may also be eligible for a cataloguing statement approved by the
National Library’s [Prepublication Data
Service](https://www.library.gov.au/services/publishers-and-self-publishers/prepublication-data-service).

##### Copyright and legal deposit requirements

You must choose a licence to release copyright materials. If you work in
government, use an open access licence if you can (for example, [Creative
Commons](https://creativecommons.org.au/)).

Read the government copyright rules in the [Australian Government intellectual
property
manual](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

The National Library of Australia collects Australian publications under the
[Copyright Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C1968A00063
). Your agency is obliged to contribute published reports through legal deposit.
Find out more [about legal deposit on the National Library
website](https://www.library.gov.au/services/publishers-and-self-publishers/legal-deposit).
This information covers online annual reports.

#### Letter of transmittal

A letter of transmittal is a message or letter to the person requesting the
report. It is often included in annual reports and other reports prepared by
committees, commissions and consultants. Sometimes it must be part of a report.

The letter of transmittal must include the purpose of the report and who it is
for. It must have:

* the signature of the person responsible for the report
* the day, month and year the report was submitted.

#### Forewords, prefaces and introductions

A report often has a foreword, preface or introduction. They have different
functions and you would rarely need them all.

A foreword:

* is always in the preliminary content
* is usually written by someone other than the author and often includes their signature
* explains the purpose of the report and why it’s important
* helps a wider audience to relate to the report.

A preface:

* is always in the preliminary content
* can replace a short introduction
* is written by the author and can include the author's signature
* tells the user why and how the report was prepared
* can include a short list of acknowledgements
* describes changes if it's a new version or update.

An introduction:

* can be in the preliminary content or main part of the report
* should be in the main part of the report if people will need the content to understand the report – for example, if the introduction includes terms of reference
* is by the author or someone else
* does not include a signature
* can replace a preface to discuss why and how the report was prepared
* includes long lists of acknowledgements
* describes changes if it’s a new version or update.

#### Contents

A list of contents helps the user to get an overview of the report. In HTML,
this can often inform the menu navigation.

Use the heading ‘Contents’, not ‘Table of contents’ or ‘List of contents’.

There is rarely a need to use more than 3 levels of headings. Use design
elements such as colour or typeface size for complex contents. This can separate
the levels of heading and show the structure of the report. Make sure design
elements are accessible.

#### Lists of images and tables

Include a list of images and tables if it is helpful to the user.

Images can include photographs, figures and maps. Most reports only need a list
of images and tables.

Give each image a page number in the list. In print, include even full-page
images that don’t have a visible page number.

The order of lists is:

1. photographs (only in print)
2. figures
3. maps (if listed separately)
4. tables.

#### Acknowledgements

There are many ways to acknowledge contributors to a report, such as in:

* the preface, if there are few acknowledgements
* the introduction, for long acknowledgements
* a separate section, if many people helped or there are a many non-bibliographic sources to note
* an appendix, if there are lengthy acknowledgements.

#### Summary

For long reports, use a summary to present findings, recommendations and
conclusions.

* Name the summary to show its purpose. For example, you can use ‘Recommendations’ or ‘Summary’.
* Don't use ‘Executive summary’. Although this is common, it is not best practice.

### Organise the main body into chapters or parts

To organise the text in the main body of the report use:

* chapters
* parts for long reports, with chapters in each part.

Both chapters and parts need short titles that tell the user what is in the
content.

Use consecutive numbering for chapter titles through the report. If the report
contains parts, continue the chapter numbering into each part. For example,
‘Part 2’ might start with ‘Chapter 5’.

There are many ways to number parts:

* Part 1, Part 2
* Part A, Part B
* Part One, Part Two.

#### Print considerations

Don't use roman numerals to number parts. Users can confuse the roman II with
the arabic number 11. It is better to start chapters and parts on a right-hand
page, particularly the first chapter and part. Also follow this approach for PDF
reports.

### Include the material that supports the report (endmatter)

In reports, endmatter can include:

* appendices
* a list of shortened forms
* a glossary
* reference lists, endnotes and bibliographies
* an index.

#### Print considerations

Page numbering for the endmatter continues from the main body of the report.

#### Appendices

Use an appendix for relevant material that is too detailed to put in the main
part of the report. This can include:

* maps
* technical information
* material from an external source that keeps an organisation's branding.

Number appendices differently from how chapters are numbered in the report. For
example, if chapters have arabic numerals (‘Chapter 1’, ‘Chapter 2’) number
appendices alphabetically (‘Appendix A’, ‘Appendix B’).

##### Print considerations

If there are several appendices, use a title page. List the title of each
appendix on the title page. The title page is usually a right-hand page.

#### List of shortened forms

Include an alphabetical list of shortened forms or abbreviations when these are
useful for the user.

If the list is brief, include it in the preliminary content. Do not incorporate
the list of shortened forms in the glossary.

#### Glossary

Use a glossary to explain specialist or unfamiliar terms. Don’t use a glossary
if there is a small number of terms to explain. You can explain these in the
main part of the report.

List glossary items in alphabetical order.

Format the glossary to make it easy for the user to find the term.

#### Reference lists, endnotes and bibliographies

Always place a bibliography after a reference list or endnotes if the report has
both.

#### Index

An index can be useful for long or detailed reports, especially in print.

#### Case studies, data lists and non-essential material

Reports can have separate information related to the main text. Examples include
case studies and lists of data.

Online reports often link to this material. Other ways of separating this from
the main body of the report are:

* using coloured backgrounds
* putting lengthy material at the end of the report, before other endmatter.

### Split large reports into volumes

Digital and printed reports can work better in volumes if they are large. Create
a volume at a suitable point in the text.

Each volume should have a summary list of the contents of the other volumes in
the set. The index can be in each volume or in the final volume only.

Number the pages according to the break in the volumes:

* When the break is in the main body of the text, continue the numbering across volumes.
* When the break is for different material (for example, endmatter), number each volume in a separate way.

#### Print considerations

Always number preliminary pages per volume.

Where numbering restarts for each volume, references should include both the
volume and page number. Where the numbering continues across volumes, use just
the page number for the reference.

## Social media

Social media can enhance your engagement with users and stakeholders. Identify
the audience, purpose and platforms and design content for them.

### Use social media to listen and engage

Social media allows government to increase understanding of users and keep them
informed.

Use a social media monitoring tool to track conversations online. Find out what
people are saying about your topic. Understand their problems and concerns.

You can use social media to:

* help people find information about government services and policy
* encourage people to engage with your agency by commenting and sharing
* share updates on important work
* promote other content, such as blog posts
* promote and encourage participation in events
* build a network of people who are interested in your agency’s work.

Anything published on social media should follow your organisation’s social
media strategy. Never rely on social media alone to engage with the community.

Get posts approved according to your organisation’s social media or
communications policy.

Australian Government employees must follow the [Guidance for Australian Public
Service Employees and
Agencies](https://www.apsc.gov.au/social-media-guidance-australian-public-service-employees-and-agencies).

#### Information management requirements

Content that you create as part of your work for the Australian Government
becomes a record. Records provide evidence of what your organisation has done
and why.

Managing and disposing of records properly is a requirement under the [Archives
Act 1983](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796). You must follow
your organisation’s information management requirements. Visit the National
Archives of Australia website for:

* [information management standards](https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/information-management-standards)
* [managing social media and instant messaging](https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/manage-information-assets/types-information/managing-social-media-and-instant-messaging-im)
* [social media policy and records management](https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/types-information-and-systems/types-information/managing-social-media/your-social-media-policy-what-about-records).

### Define the audience before you write

Find out who will engage with your post and why before you start writing. Each
social media platform has a different audience.

Each platform has its own analytics tool to help you learn about them.

Ensure there's capacity to engage with comments and enquiries on your post.

### Design for each relevant platform

Prepare content specifically for each platform. Check that a social media
platform is the best option before you publish.

* Will it help the people who use your services and products?
* Will it help them understand the people and processes of government?

Not every platform is appropriate for every message.

Content needs to be accessible no matter which platform you use, including
[video and audio content](/node/42).

The following platforms are currently popular in government and the Australian
community.

#### LinkedIn

Business, government and industry use LinkedIn for professional networking.
LinkedIn is suitable for publishing:

* job openings and career opportunities
* professional insights
* case studies
* information about training and other opportunities
* industry news.

#### X (formerly Twitter)

News media, industry and government use X (formerly Twitter) for networking,
news and public commentary.

X is a platform for current content. Use X to tap into current events, news and
positive stories.

The maximum length of tweets is 280 characters. Write one idea in a short,
attention-grabbing sentence. Most tweets have a key idea and a link to a
webpage. Don’t use internet slang in government tweets.

Use keywords in hashtags, which have a ## symbol. Hashtags help people find and
follow topics of interest. If you are publishing a new topic, try to use an
existing or trending hashtag rather than creating a new one.

You need no more than 2 hashtags. Too many hashtags makes your content difficult
to read and less accessible.

Use ‘camel case’ for compound hashtags. The first letter of each word in the
hashtag starts with a capital letter – for example, ##SelfQuarantine.

Address other users with the @ sign before their username. Remember, these
tweets are public and visible.

#### Facebook

People use Facebook for personal social networking, business promotion,
entertainment and news. Do not publish technical content on Facebook.

Facebook is suitable for publishing:

* human interest stories
* profiles of staff
* information for communities of practice
* events
* career opportunities.

Videos on Facebook should be interesting and as short as possible. They should
have only one message that is clear in the first second.

Facebook content has less than 2 seconds to grab attention before people scroll
past it, if they see it at all. Content needs to be compelling so it reaches the
people you want to reach.

#### YouTube

YouTube videos cover entertainment, instructional and lifestyle topics, among
many others.

Most videos on YouTube are between 3 and 12 minutes in length and can:

* show people how to do something
* explain a complex topic
* share human interest stories
* celebrate case studies
* include people in events.

YouTube videos should:

* be well produced
* include a compelling title
* include a poster frame – a still image that acts as a thumbnail for the video.

#### Instagram

People use Instagram for entertainment, news, lifestyle, social networking and
business. It is popular in the technical and design communities.

Share photographs and short videos on Instagram. Showcase interesting people,
places and technology.

Instagram content should either:

* be visually creative
* create a sense of intimacy with the people behind the account.

Links don’t work well on Instagram. Include all your information in the post
rather than linking to websites.

### Use plain language and the right tone

Use plain language and a conversational, positive tone on social media. Avoid
jargon and acronyms.

Aim to be topical and timely with your posts, rather than workshopping them to
perfection – but avoid obvious mistakes.

You can use an exclamation mark or a question mark after:

* a web address (URL)
* a tag
* a hashtag
* an emoji.

Don’t add a full stop after hashtags, emojis or handles.

Follow your organisation’s guidelines about appropriate use of emojis. Use them
sparingly.

#### Accessibility and inclusivity requirements

Use emojis, not emoticons. Emojis are [standardised
pictographs](https://home.unicode.org/emoji/about-emoji/). Emoticons display as
punctuation marks in text and are not standardised.

Choose common emojis and make sure the user can understand the message if the
emoji is removed.

Content needs respect all people, their rights and their heritage. Use inclusive
imagery and [inclusive language](/node/178).

### Include images and video that enhance the message

Social media is a visual-first, mobile-first medium. Plan content with this in
mind.

Use video and images as the basis of your content wherever possible. Visual
content needs to be timely, relevant and engaging. Set the video [aspect and
resolution for the user’s
device](/node/41##set_the_video_aspect_and_resolution_for_the_users_device).

Use alt text and closed captions, or provide a link to content with these
elements. Also ensure you include any text in the image that is in the text of
the post itself.

Follow your organisation’s [branding
guidelines](/node/41##apply_government_branding_to_all_audio_and_video). Official
photography should carry your organisation’s mark or logo in the bottom
right-hand corner.

You might need to use release forms before you use anyone’s image in any social
media platform. Before you post, [check if you have the right
permissions](/node/41##get_permissions_and_licences_for_copyright_material).

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can understand any information contained in an image.
* I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.

Fundamentals:

* Include images, video and audio on a page only if they meet a real user need. Make sure the contrast is sufficient for all users.
* Prepare [alt text for images](/node/49).
* Follow the [requirements for video and audio](/node/41).

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [1.1.1 Non-text content – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##non-text-content)
* [1.4.2 Contrast (minimum) – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##contrast-minimum)
* [1.4.5 Images of text - level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##images-of-text)
* [1.4.6 Contrast (extended) – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##contrast-enhanced)
* [1.4.11 Non-text contrast – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##non-text-contrast)

##### Copyright requirements

You must [get permission (a licence) to use copyright
material](/node/41##get_permissions_and_licences_for_copyright_material). This
includes video and images.

Some material is available under an open access licence, such as [Creative
Commons](https://creativecommons.org.au/).

You must [attribute copyright material](/node/174).

Read the government copyright rules in the [Australian Government intellectual
property
manual](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

### Post content at the times that suit the audience

Timing is a critical component of successful content. Post when something is
still fresh and people are still interested. It is this immediacy that gives you
authority when you publish something to social media.

Publish on a schedule that is appropriate for the platform, but only if you have
something to say and can say it well. People may start to ignore your posts if:

* you publish too often
* your content is not well written or newsworthy.

### Manage risk with a social media policy

Social media encourages people to engage in a discussion with your organisation.
Have a social media policy with a clear framework for what is and what is not
acceptable behaviour.

Prepare a social media risk assessment to identify:

* potential risks to your organisation’s reputation
* the steps you will take to mitigate that risk.

Many organisations have talking points or standard responses for replying to
comments.

Social media content is designed to be shared. Ask for your organisation’s
social media strategy before you share other people’s posts. Sharing may imply
endorsement.

Content that you post can also be shared out of context, and it is almost
impossible to remove content once it is in the public domain.

Think carefully about how someone might interpret posts without any context. Be
specific so the context is clear from the post itself. This helps people
understand the message you intend.

Be aware of privacy concerns and offensive material on social media.

#### Privacy requirements

Your organisation has obligations under the [Privacy Act
1988](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/).

Privacy is relevant whenever it’s possible to identify someone. Treat things
that can or might identify an individual as personal information. A social media
post might feature someone’s picture as an image or in a video, for example.

When you handle personal information, you must comply with the [Australian
Privacy
Principles](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/).
Personal information is any information that could identify an individual and
apply to any format.

The Privacy Act and Privacy Principles also apply to any personal information
you collect from a social media platform. People have the right to request
access to their personal information under the Privacy Principles and
the [Freedom of Information Act
1982](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02562).

The federal regulator for privacy and freedom of information legislation is the
[Office of the Australian Information Commissioner](https://www.oaic.gov.au/).

## Video and audio

Video and audio are time-based media. Users can choose when and how much they
view or listen to. If the format meets a user need, make sure anyone can access
the content.

### Use video or audio when users find it easy to understand and access

Ask whether time-based media (video or audio) is the best way to deliver a
message or tell a story.

Check you:

* understand who will use it, how they will access it and why
* have (or can you get) the resources and expertise to do it.

Use video or audio if it:

* suits the type of information you want to include
* helps you reach most people who need to find that information
* is accessible to those people.

Some users might find another content format more useful. If you create video or
audio content, be aware of:

* accessibility for time-based media (for example, closed captions)
* the potential effect of flickering and dynamic content on a screen
* language difficulties
* the user’s environment (for example, a workplace where sound disturbs colleagues)
* timing in the content and the time users are likely to spend using the content.

Provide a text alternative to video and audio for:

* users who cannot reliably read captions or hear audio
* users who have time pressures
* search engine optimisation (SEO).

Before deciding if video or audio is the right format, do [user
research](/node/76).

Time-based media need more resources than text to produce, maintain and update.
Text-based content is usually a more feasible and accessible option to meet a
user need.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can access equivalent information to anything contained in a video or audio file.
* I can easily control how I see and hear distinctions if colour or sound convey meaning.

Fundamentals:

* Create accessible video and audio with the correct alternative versions so everyone can access the information.
* Meet AAA success criteria for video when content is of national importance. For example, for voting or Census participation and access to National Health and Safety information.
* Follow the detailed [requirements for video and audio](/node/41).

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [1.2.1 Audio-only and video-only (prerecorded) – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=124%2C129%2C121##audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded)

### Create video if the user needs a quick explanation

Video works best when it is short, accessible and shows something people need to
know quickly.

Governments use video to communicate with their employees and the public. Some
uses are to:

* introduce new topics and ideas
* promote government programs
* explain policies and procedures to staff
* show people how to do something, such as complete a form
* stream events and ceremonies.

All video production requires a level of in-house and external professional
expertise. Follow the [requirements and standards for video and
audio](/node/41).

#### Duration

Online videos should have one key message. They should be be no more than one to
2 minutes long, especially if you share the video on social media.

Videos covering complex topics and hosted on your organisation’s website can be
longer. Check your organisation’s policy for the preferred length of videos.

Break the video into smaller, stand-alone pieces if:

* the message is complex
* there is more than one message.

#### Platform

You can place video on webpages, blogs or social media channels. Once you have
chosen a platform, check its video publishing guidelines. Video is the preferred
format of some [social media
platforms](/node/43##design_for_each_relevant_platform). Check which file format
the platform accepts.

#### Tags

You can add tags or hashtags on any platform to help people find video content.
Add hashtags across several platforms to increase the likelihood that people
will find the video.

Use words that the user is most likely to type into search engines.

#### Animation

Use animation to show complex processes or abstract ideas.

Animation works well on social media platforms. People can usually understand
them with or without audio.

As for other types of videos, animation must tell a story. You should include a
call to action so users know what they can do next.

Animation videos are not only cartoons or slideshows. Use animated infographics
to show and explain government information and services. Examples include:

* evolving timelines and charts
* moving text on maps and graphs
* interactive graphics that allow an expanded view or that change when selected.

Use professionals to create animation videos. Animators:

* structure and evolve messages in creative ways
* understand how viewers respond to different elements of animation design
* pace the changes onscreen so viewers have the time to understand what is happening.

##### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can understand any information contained in an image.
* I can easily control how I see and hear distinctions if colour or sound convey meaning.

Fundamentals:

* When using text or images of text in animation, meet minimum requirements for colour contrast.
* Ensure colour is not the only means of conveying meaning.
* Follow the [requirements and standards for video and audio](/node/41).

WCAG quick reference:

* [1.4.1 Use of colour – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=128##use-of-color)
* [1.4.3 Contrast (minimum) – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=128##contrast-minimum)

#### Live action video

Use live action to show people in a real-world environment.

Live action requires careful composition. Ensure that the subject is:

* clearly lit
* in focus
* not obstructed by other features.

Use candid shots and real scenes that are simple, interesting and original.
Visuals should be crisp and use natural colours.

People in the video should wear appropriate clothing and avoid:

* offensive slogans or slogans that will distract the viewer
* branding and logos
* fine patterns and stripes, which reduce image quality by creating a ‘moiré’ pattern.

Moiré patterns give a distorted representation of fine detail in an image.

#### Broadcasting live

Use live broadcast to record events as they happen.

Live broadcast works well for discussions, addresses and interviews. Often, they
are broadcast in-house to staff in government agencies.

A live broadcast needs equipment, scripting, lighting, staging and audio
expertise.

##### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

I can access equivalent information to anything contained in a video or audio
file.

Fundamentals:

* Include live captioning in synchronised media for live broadcasts to ensure content is available to all users.
* Follow the [requirements and standards for video and audio](/node/41).

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

[1.2.4 Captions (live) – level
AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=128##captions-live)

### Add audio if the user needs more help to understand

Audio supports video (audio-visual content), or can be its own type of content
(audio-only content). Many agencies also produce audio descriptions of written
material to make content accessible.

Examples of audio-visual content include:

* soundtracks for online training material
* audio for videos, filmed presentations and live events
* short sound files for government and agency branding.

Examples of government audio-only content are:

* oral histories
* historical recordings used for educational purposes
* podcasts.

Audio-only content can be an engaging and relatable way to explain complex
topics. You can:

* record events, such as speeches
* create longer-form audio, such as podcasts
* use historical audio of people and events to bring the past alive for listeners.

Audio-only content can improve someone’s understanding of a topic. It takes a
lot of resources to create, enhance and publish audio on its own. Other formats
may meet user needs more effectively. Do user research to find out who will
listen to the audio and why.

Follow the [requirements and standards for audio](/node/41).

### Finalise the script before you start recording

Have a clear story before you begin production.

Effective audio-visual or audio-only content begins with a script that:

* outlines what the content will cover (the beginning)
* uses action and audio to show the key idea (the middle)
* tells people about what they can do next (the end).

Take the time to create a well-written script with a clear structure.

Ensure audio and supporting text use [inclusive language](/node/178). Show
inclusion and diversity in imagery (for audio-visual content) and script roles.

Agree on the script with stakeholders and approvers before you record. It’s much
easier to change a script or outline than the content once you produce it.

Use the script as the basis for the text version (media alternative) for the
recording to meet accessibility and SEO requirements.

#### Structure and format

Script-writing requires technical skill. A good script is written by someone who
either:

* understands the topic and can write a script to support it
* can do the necessary research and work with a subject expert.

Otherwise, there’s a risk the script will not be accurate. This means users
may get the wrong message or mistrust what they hear and stop
listening. Consider using a professional script writer.

Scripts provide clear directions for speakers about emphasis and pronunciation.
When printed or displayed, scripts use:

* a plain font
* wide line spacing
* white space
* short paragraphs
* short sentences and some longer sentences to reflect speech patterns
* markers for brief pauses throughout to help speakers breathe and listeners think

The length of the script depends on the topic and the format you’re recording.

Some video and audio formats are partially scripted. The partial script will
outline both the beginning and the end of the content, but might not structure
the middle.

For an interview, you might create a conversation outline with a series of
questions. Responses and follow-up questions might be unscripted. You should
still write the beginning and end of the content as script.

#### Language and tone in audio-only content

Because audio-only content isn’t supported by images, language and tone of voice
are important:

* Use simple language and a conversational tone, and avoid jargon.
* Don’t over-simplify to the point where you lose meaning and people feel patronised.

A conversational tone also helps the speakers inject their personalities into
the script. Follow Australian Public Service values, regardless of the topic.

#### Proofing

Read the script aloud. This is the best way to find out what works and what
doesn’t work. You can record yourself and listen back to build empathy with
users.

Check that the script explains what users want or need to understand. If it
doesn’t, rewrite it.

Use a timer to help you work out how long the script might take to record.

### Choose actors and speakers to suit the content (the talent)

‘Talent’ is the industry term for the people who feature in video and
audio content.

The talent you engage, and when you engage them, depends on the type of content.
For example, you might:

* plan an oral history project around a particular speaker
* engage an expert speaker who understands technical subjects.

It can also make sense to find suitable speakers after you write the script.
Some audio needs professional interview skills or voice talent.

Make sure:

* the people being recorded speak clearly
* speech is at a rate of between 130 and 170 words per minute. This is about the rate of an Australian giving a speech that is easy to understand
* you record at a volume, pace, tone and rhythm that are appropriate to the message.

You might also:

* factor the cost of a speaker into your planning (and budget)
* consider your approach to recruiting diverse talent, as more people relate to audio-visual content that is inclusive and representative.

Ensure everyone featuring in video or audio content signs a release form.

#### Privacy requirements

Your organisation has obligations under the [Privacy Act
1988](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/).

Privacy is relevant whenever it's possible to identify someone. Treat things
that can or might identify an individual as personal information. Personal
information can include things like a voice recording or someone's appearance.

When you handle personal information, you must comply with the [Australian
Privacy
Principles](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/).
Personal information is any information that could identify an individual, in
any format.

## Requirements and standards for video and audio

Users need transcripts, captions and audio descriptions for accessibility. Work
with experts to record and mix audio. Check branding, copyright and permissions
requirements.

### Make sure everyone can access audio and video

Audio-visual content must have:

* a transcript for people who don’t want to watch the video or listen to the audio – and for [search engine indexing](/node/103)
* closed captions for people who can’t hear the dialogue and other sounds (symbol [CC])
* an audio description for people who can’t see the video.

Audio description is narration. It gives important details that are only visual,
usually during gaps in the dialogue.

Choose an accessible media player that:

* can be operated with a keyboard and mouse
* can display closed captions
* adapts resolutions to support low bandwidth connections
* works in landscape and portrait mode.

YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo and many other common video platforms often have this
functionality.

Don’t set video or animation to autoplay. Do not include anything that flashes
more than 3 times in any one second period.

Make sure the colour contrast of text in videos is at least 4.5:1.

Normalise your audio to make sure each recording has the same volume.

Remove background sounds or make sure they are at least 20 decibels lower than
the foreground speech content.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can access equivalent information to anything contained in a video or audio file.
* I can easily control how I see and hear distinctions if colour or sound convey meaning.
* I can operate the content using only a keyboard.
* I can use content without experiencing a seizure or physical reaction.
* I can access equivalent information to anything contained in a video or audio file.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [1.2 Time-based media (all criteria)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=124%2C129%2C121##time-based-media)
* [1.4.2 Audio control – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=124%2C129%2C121##audio-control)
* [1.4.3 Contrast (minimum) – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=124%2C129%2C121##contrast-minimum)
* [1.4.7 Low or no background audio – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=124%2C129%2C121##low-or-no-background-audio)
* [2.1.1 Keyboard – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=124%2C129%2C121##keyboard)
* [2.3 Seizures and physical reactions (all criteria)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=124%2C129%2C121##seizures-and-physical-reactions)

### Include a transcript for audio-visual and audio-only

Time-based media (video and audio) must have a transcript so they are accessible
to everyone. Transcripts are also important for search engine indexing.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

I can access equivalent information to anything contained in a video or audio
file.

WCAG quick reference:

* [1.2.1 Audio-only and video-only (prerecorded) – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded)
* [1.2.3 Audio description or media alternative (prerecorded) – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded)
* [1.2.8 Media alternative (prerecorded) – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##media-alternative-prerecorded)

Have a person transcribe the text. There are many professional services that
offer transcription. If you use automated transcribing software, review it for
errors and correct them.

* Format the transcript in plain text or simple HTML.
* Consider breaking the transcript into headings and adding time markers. This means that people can easily find and play a part of the audio.
* You can place the transcript on the same page as the content. Alternatively, you can also add a link below or beside the content to a page with the transcript.

Include all dialogue and the speakers’ names. If there is only one speaker,
introduce them by name in the transcript. You can then leave out their name with
the dialogue, unless it is crucial to the content.

Write non-verbal information in square brackets.

<example>
‘… to get to the other side [laughing].’</example>

End the transcript with ‘End of transcript’.

### Include subtitles or captions for video

Subtitles and captions are not the same:

* Subtitles display only the dialogue and are commonly used for translations.
* Captions display any audio in a video, including dialogue and sound cues.

Captions can be open captions or closed captions.

W3C’s Making audio and video media accessible has more instructions at
‘[Captions/subtitles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/captions/)’.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

I can access equivalent information to anything contained in a video or audio
file.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [1.2.2 Captions (prerecorded) – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##captions-prerecorded)
* [1.2.4 Captions (live) – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##captions-live)

Open captions, which the user cannot turn off, are burned onto the video itself.
Closed captions can be turned on or off by the user.

If you have a choice, closed captions are preferable to subtitles or open
captions. Some media players also allow for multilingual captions that users can
select on demand if they need translations.

Use Australian terms and spelling for an Australian audience, regardless of the
accent or intention of the speaker. Government agencies might use alternative
spellings in video content for some overseas audiences.

Closed captions come in many file formats. SRT is a common format and is
compatible with most online platforms and media players.

Load the closed caption file onto the video platform as a separate file to the
video file. This allows the user to turn the captions on or off.

You can edit closed caption files.

#### Time the captions and subtitles to match the dialogue

Keep captions and subtitles short: no more than 2 lines, with no more than 42
characters per line. Make line breaks where there is a natural break in the
sentence (for example, after a comma).

People read about 2 lines of text in 2 seconds. Test that users can read the
captions in the time available.

Don’t leave the captions on the screen:

* after the speech has finished
* across the transition from one scene to the next.

Try to ensure a small break of at least 4 frames between subtitles.

Review and edit the accuracy and synchronised timing of the captions for pre
recorded video.

#### Centre subtitles and captions at the bottom of the screen

If there are 2 speakers:

* give each speaker a separate line and start each line with a dash
* align each line to the left of the subtitle block so that their left edges stack above each other
* centre the whole subtitle or caption block.

Don’t use a full stop at the end of subtitles. Use an ellipsis to indicate the
end of a sentence where speech trails off or where a sentence remains
unfinished.

Use italics for:

* foreign words and phrases
* dialogue that is not on the screen, such as a public announcement or dialogue from a television program.

A hash symbol (##) or a quaver symbol (♪) show song lyrics.

### Add audio description for video

Audio description tells people what is happening in the visual elements of the
video. It could be the only way someone who is blind or has low vision will know
visual cues such as the:

* setting
* costumes
* displayed text (such as a sign)
* movements.

The audio description describes these visual cues to low-vision users during
gaps in the dialogue.

W3C’s Making audio and video media accessible details this aspect of
accessibility in ‘[Audio description of visual
information](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/description/)’.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

I can access equivalent information to anything contained in a video or audio
file.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [1.2.3 Audio description or media alternative (prerecorded) – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded)
* [1.2.5 Audio description (prerecorded) – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##audio-description-prerecorded)
* [1.2.7 Extended audio description (prerecorded) – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##extended-audio-description-prerecorded)

You don’t need an audio description for dialogue delivered straight to camera
(‘talking heads’).

For anything else, you need to identify who is speaking in the description. If
location is important, include that too.

Use audio description to give context if it is not obvious from the title.

Ensure that:

* the content is accurate
* the describer speaks clearly.

### Include a title, description and metadata

Any video or audio content you publish must have:

* a title, description and metadata
* an appropriate file name.

The title and description tell people what the content is about. Make sure the
title:

* has fewer than 70 characters so that search engines can find it
* includes keywords
* is descriptive, telling users what the content is about.

The description puts the content in context wherever you’re publishing it. The
description helps users know what they’ll get out of the content so they can
decide whether to view it.

Use the description to explain if the content is part of a series and tell
people how they can subscribe. You can also add:

* branding
* a publication date
* links to related webpages.

Each file format has different metadata fields. Metadata tags store specific
information about the file, like the:

* creation date
* creator
* owner
* talent
* file size
* file name.

Some fill automatically, such as the creation date. You’ll have to fill other
fields manually. Search engines use information from metadata to include files
in searches.

#### Information management requirements

You must [use the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) when preparing
government
information](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/information/sensitive-classified-information/Pages/default.aspx).
The PSPF covers how information is classified and marked, and what this means
for its storage, handling, access and disposal. Consult the PSPF webpages or
your organisation’s protective security policy.

You must also follow your organisation’s information management requirements.
Information (including data) that you create as part of your work for the
Australian Government is a record. It provides evidence of what your
organisation has done and why.

Managing and disposing of records properly is a requirement under the [Archives
Act 1983](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796). For guidance,
visit the National Archives of Australia website for content on [information
management
standards](https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/information-management-standards).

### Store video in a standard file format

All video should be in MP4 (MPEG4), a commercial and commonly used video file
format. MP4 is a compressed digital video file format that allows streaming and
downloading of videos from the internet. Most mobile devices support MP4 videos
without people having to install an application (app) to play them. MP4 also
supports metadata tags, attachments and interactive menus.

### Meet common audio-only technical specifications

Audio-only content must meet common technical specifications (specs) for
publishing on different platforms:

* Government agencies have internal guidelines for publishing audio on their websites.
* Audio hosting platforms have their own spec lists for audio quality.

### Use a booth or studio if you can

It is best to record audio in a sound booth or recording studio. If you don’t
have access to either, choose an environment you can control.

Recording in quiet environments makes it easier to understand the dialogue.
Don’t record in windy conditions and environments with:

* background noise from air conditioners
* background noise from people talking
* hard surfaces such as glass and concrete, because sound bounces off them.

Location noise is sometimes used in audio to set the scene or to indicate a time
progression. Including this is a job for audio professionals.

Don’t record in noisy environments. Instead, record in quiet spaces with soft
furnishings such as carpets or fabric, because they absorb sound.

### Get expert help to edit and mix audio

The aim of audio editing is to produce audio that:

* is clear and technically balanced
* sounds natural while telling a cohesive and engaging story.

Whoever edits the audio must have the technical expertise to meet the
accessibility and technical standards required. They will be familiar with audio
editing tools, including restoration and enhancement software.

If the audio includes music or sound effects, you must still be able to hear and
understand the person speaking. If several people are speaking, it should be
easy to tell each person’s voice from the other.

Mix historical audio to match the same level of decibels as the rest of the
recording.

Accessibility relates closely to technical standards for audio. W3C’s Making
audio and video media accessible gives an overview of the relationship in
‘[Audio content and video
content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/av-content/)’.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

I can easily control how I see and hear distinctions if colour or sound convey
meaning.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

[1.4.7 Low or no background audio – level
AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=124%2C129%2C121##low-or-no-background-audio)

### Apply government branding to all audio and video

Branding applies to all government content, regardless of the platform that
supports access to the content.

#### Text in video

Style all text in videos:

* with clear and simple fonts (sans serif is usually the best choice)
* to ensure that the text contrasts strongly with the background.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

I can easily control how I see and hear distinctions if colour or sound convey
meaning.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

[1.4.3 Contrast (minimum) – level
AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=124%2C129%2C121##contrast-minimum)

Avoid effects if they make the text less readable. Seek expert advice if you
plan to use text effects (such as drop shadows, outlines and tinted blocks). If
they are well designed, they can help give enough contrast and separation to
make the text easier to read. Poorly designed text effects can make text very
difficult to read.

Avoid colours that make the video less accessible for some users. For example,
avoid using red and green as the only way to convey meaning.

#### Visual identifiers

Use your organisation’s branding guidelines to make sure any video is clearly
government content. Visual branding tells people that video is created on behalf
of the Australian Government.

Check that all text complies with your organisation’s branding guidelines. This
includes text formatting and spelling. In this way, the video text is consistent
with other content that your organisation publishes.

#### Branded sounds

Check if your agency has ‘branded’ sounds (also called audio logos). These help
users immediately associate audio-visual or audio-only content with your agency.

Branded sounds occur at the very beginning or end of the content. They need to
be short (no longer than 6 seconds) and provide a consistent identity for your
organisation.

### Set the video aspect and resolution for the user’s device

Whether you publish the video on a platform or your agency website, you will
need to consider aspect ratio and resolution. Videos are more usable if they use
as much of the screen space as possible.

Most people use their mobile devices (phones and tablets) to access [social
media](/node/43). Square videos (with a 1:1 aspect ratio) are popular on
Instagram. Vertical videos (with a 9:16 aspect ratio) are popular in the Stories
feature in Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and other platforms.

The videos you access on a desktop computer are usually a horizontal rectangle.
They usually have a 16:9 horizontal aspect ratio, with a minimum resolution of
1,920 pixels wide by 1,080 pixels high.

       Figure: Aspect ratios for horizontal and vertical display on mobile devices  
### Introduce speakers in the video using text and graphics (lower thirds)

‘Lower thirds’ is the term for a graphic and text overlay that show a speaker’s
name, organisation and role. Using lower thirds is mandatory. They are usually
an image file added into the video editing application.

Despite the name, lower thirds don’t have to be in the lower third of the
screen. Be guided by where the person’s face appears. They must appear in the
‘title-safe’ area. This is the area within a video frame where you can put text
without the edges of the screen cutting it off. When adding a lower third to a
video, a title-safe guide in the editing application appears over the text to
help position it.

Be careful when lower thirds appear on the screen: don’t obscure the video’s
captions and subtitles.

For interviews or ‘talking heads’, the usual style is to place the speaker’s
name on the top line. Place the speaker’s title and organisation on the second
line.

Lower thirds must:

* be appropriate for government content
* be correct
* be as short as possible
* have a strong contrast with the video’s background
* use a text font that is readable at smaller resolutions or when compressed.

A sans serif font is the easiest to read, but use your organisation’s branding
and style.

### Get permissions and licences for copyright material

You must have a signed release from people who appear in a video. This includes
everyone who is filmed and people whose voices have been recorded. Keep the
signed release form and give a copy to the person who signed it.

#### Privacy requirements

Your organisation has obligations under the [Privacy Act
1988](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/).

Privacy is relevant whenever it’s possible to identify someone. Treat things
that can or might identify an individual as personal information. Personal
information can include things like a voice recording or someone’s appearance.

When you handle personal information, you must comply with the [Australian
Privacy
Principles](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/).
Personal information is any information that could identify an individual, in
any format.

Other restrictions might apply to copyright.

Some donors of material to collecting institutions may have restricted its use.
Donors may also need to give written permission before you use material. Check
with the collecting institution.

Before you use First Nations Australians’ content, you need proper permissions.
Always consult with relevant communities (or individuals) and copyright
holders. The permissions process is vital and [differs from standard copyright
procedures](/node/179##consultation_is_a_must).

#### Copyright requirements

You must get permission (a licence) to use copyright material. This includes
text, lyrics, images, video and sounds.

You must choose a licence to release copyright materials. If you work in
government, use an open access licence if you can (for example, [Creative
Commons](https://creativecommons.org.au/)).

Read the government copyright rules in the [Australian Government intellectual
property
manual](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

### Use stock video if it enhances the production

Stock video is short content that you have not produced. Using stock video can
save production time and money.

Government has its own stock video resources of large audiovisual collections,
dating back to the 1890s. Collections cover a wide range of topics about
Australian life, culture and history. For research support and usage terms and
conditions, contact the respective access teams at the [National Film and Sound
Archive of Australia](https://www.nfsa.gov.au/) and the [National Archives of
Australia](https://www.naa.gov.au/).

Be careful with commercial stock video. People will identify and dismiss stock
video that looks as if it is not Australian or doesn’t seem genuine.

Other than historical material, ensure that stock video:

* is crisp
* has natural colours
* focuses on people
* meets common technical standards
* is visibly Australian.

To use a stock video, you must purchase a licence from its owner. Some stock
video has a Creative Commons licence.

## Italics

Italic type contrasts with roman type. It draws people’s attention to convey
meaning. Use italic type sparingly as it can affect readability.

### Limit use of italics

Italics are sloping letters. Roman type is upright and the default font type.

Italic type makes text stand out from surrounding roman type. The contrast can
help readers notice important words, identify differences and find those words
again.

<example>
The Australian of the Year honour is a government award. It is different from
The Australian’s annual award of the same name. [Publication titles use italics,
but not awards.]</example>

Italics lose their effectiveness when many italicised words appear on a page.

Limit italics to the uses described on this page, which link to detailed
guidance.

Don’t use italics for:

* large blocks of text
* material that would normally be in italics but is set apart (such as a list of titles under a heading)
* aggregation pages (such as a [page listing legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.au/search/status(inforce)/type(principal)/collection(act))).

Overuse affects the content’s accessibility, [readability and
usability](/node/60##rhythm_changes_can_help_or_hinder_reading).

People with disability experience text in many ways. Many have no problems
interpreting your written words in any way you present them.

Italic type has different letter shapes to surrounding text. This feature can
cause issues for some people with reading difficulties.

#### Accessibility requirements

User need:

I can read and understand text, even if there are unusual words and shortened
forms, or languages other than English.

Fundamentals:

* Use a consistent type style. For some users, it can be difficult to read the text when presented in a style that is different or unfamiliar. This includes changes to the shapes of letters, as between roman and italic type.
* [Avoid chunks of italic text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning.html).

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criterion:[Guideline 3.1 –
readable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##readable). (WCAG 2.0 advisory
techniques remain relevant.)

### Italicise titles of stand-alone works, legal cases and Acts

A title or name in italic type shows that it is formal and complete. Shortened
versions of the title and common titles are in roman type. Follow the [detailed
guidance for referencing and attribution](/node/181).

Don’t use italics for the titles of sacred texts, such as the Bible or the
Koran.

#### Published works

Use italics for the [titles of these published
works](/node/165##style_and_spell_titles_consistently):

* books and periodicals
* plays
* classics
* most musical compositions
* ballets and operas
* films, videos and podcasts
* blogs
* television and radio programs
* artworks.

<example>
David Williamson’s play Emerald city was first performed in 1987.

Elena Kats-Chernin’s Piano concerto no. 3 is a recent work by the award-winning
composer.

In 2018, Yvette Coppersmith won the Archibald Prize with Self-portrait, after
George Lambert.</example>

Unpublished works are in roman type.

##### Reverse italics in titles of published works

In some titles, there are words that would normally be italicised. To make sure
they stand out from the rest of the italicised title, write the words in roman
type. This is called ‘reverse italics’.

<example>
Gone on The Ghan and other great railway journeys of Australia [The Ghan is the
official name of a train; it would normally be italicised.]</example>

#### Full titles of Acts and legal cases

Use italics for primary legislation and legal cases but not for delegated
legislation or bills. Follow the [guidance for legal material](/node/163).

<example>
The Franklin Dam Case is the informal title of Commonwealth v Tasmania (1983)
158 CLR 1. The case led to the World Heritage Properties Conservation Bill which
became an Act in 1983. In 1999, the Act was replaced by parts of the Environment
Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.

[The case name and the Act are italicised; the name for the bill, before
enacted, is in roman type.]</example>

### Set off most foreign words and phrases

Italics contrast words and phrases that are not in English from surrounding
text. Foreign words and phrases should generally be avoided in government
writing, unless there is no English equivalent.

<example>
The more things change, plus c’est la même.</example>

Standard Australian English can absorb words or phrases from other languages.
Write these ‘borrowed’ words without italics or accent marks.

<example>
John was the head barista at the department’s coffee shop.</example>

Check a dictionary if you are unsure about whether a word of foreign origin
should be italics.

Do not italicise [names or words from First Nations
languages](/node/179##style_for_first_australian_languages_needs_to_recognise_continuing_cultures).
They are Australian languages, not foreign languages.

### Don’t use italics for Latin shortened forms

The ‘common use’ principle applies to Latin shortened forms (such as ‘etc.’ and
‘i.e.’). Write the full Latin word in italics but not the shortened form.

<example>
The abbreviation ‘cf.’ is from the Latin word confer and means ‘compare’.</example>

### Show that formulas and some text have special meaning

Italics are often used for the first instance of a technical term when it’s
defined or introduced for the first time. Instead, to draw attention to words
with special meaning, [use single quotation marks](/node/114).

Specialist uses of italics include well-known [mathematical theorems and
formulas](/node/145).

<example>
Pythagoras’s theorem for a right-angled triangle proved that a2 + b2 = c2.</example>

#### Special material

Some content needs to be set apart from the text for readers to make sense of
it. Examples of italicised notes, instructions and extra material in published
works include:

* Theatre and film scripts can use italics for stage directions.
* Books often italicise a prelude or brief introductory remark to set the scene.
* Musical scripts sometimes use italics for instructions.

Remember to avoid blocks of italics wherever possible. Blocks of italics are
difficult to read, so consider other formatting and design options.

#### Official names of vehicles

Ships, trains, aircraft and other vehicles sometimes have a proper name. The
name is in italics excluding any definite article. The brand or type of vehicle
is in roman type.

<example>
Until 1997, Queen Elizabeth II would use the Britannia to sail to official
visits overseas. [The definite article ‘the’ is in roman type, while the ship’s
official name is in italics.]

Qantas uses Australian names like Great Southern Land for the Dreamliner fleet.
</example>

Follow the [detailed guidance for official names of vehicles](/node/87).

#### Scientific names

Use italics for the genus and species, including any subspecies, but not for the
common name.

Write the scientific names of infectious organisms, including some bacteria and
fungi, in italics.

<example>
Acacia phlebocarpa is the scientific name for the tabletop wattle.

Certain strains of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus cause golden staph.
</example>

Follow the [detailed guidance for names of plants and animals](/node/96). This
guidance also relates to [medical terms](/node/97##italicise_organism_names).

### Stress words with special emphasis, but rarely

Sometimes you want to stress a word for meaning or to convey emotion, including
a change in tone. Italics, used sparingly, can work for this purpose.

<example>

#### Example

‘I didn’t mean her,’ they said, ‘I meant him.’

The deadline is Monday, not Friday.
</example>

Don’t use italics when another style or formatting option is available. Single
quotation marks can work for emphasis unless they’re serving a different
stylistic use.

#### Emphasis in quotations

Sometimes, you might want to add italics to quotations to bring attention to
particular words or phrases. If you do this, write ‘emphasis added’ in square
brackets following the italicised text. This way, people will know the italics
didn’t appear in the original quotation.

<example>

##### Example

‘Subsequently, in 1903, Parliament passed a unanimous resolution that it should
be flown.’ [emphasis added]
</example>

If the italics is part of the original text, write ‘emphasis from original’ in
the square brackets following the quotation.

## Australian place names

Spell official place names correctly. Follow style rules so people recognise
names for other public places. Use standard shortened forms in addresses. 

### Check official place names and style them correctly

Using official Australian place names helps us all communicate more clearly. You
can check the spelling of a place name using the [Australian Place Names
dataset](https://placenames.fsdf.org.au/).

If still unsure, contact the relevant state or territory naming authority. You
can click on the government logos in the search results from the dataset.
They will take you to the jurisdictional webpage.

Official place names are generally given under Acts of parliament and associated
rules. Each state and territory has its own legal and administrative processes.

National principles for naming are intended to provide consistency across the
country. This helps ensure that wherever we go in Australia, we find names are
chosen and spelt in a common way.

Place names reflect culture at various points throughout history. Because of
this reality, there may appear to be exceptions to the general rules given in
this guide.

There are many First Nations naming systems across Australia. These were in
place before the official national system and continue today.

Many names from First Nations languages have become official names, used by all
Australians. There are also many that have not. Consult directly with relevant
communities about conventions for [naming and spelling in specific First Nations
languages](/node/179).

#### Spelling and capitalisation

Australian place names are proper nouns, written using standard Australian
English. Place names:

* use a standard 26 character alphabet
* don’t use diacritical marks
* are not possessive
* don’t generally have punctuation.

Some Australian place names stem from other languages. Spelling and
capitalisation can change when they’re adopted as an official Australian place
name. For example, the official spelling:

* loses any accent marks or diacritics
* adds capitalisation.

<example> 
##### Correct
D’Entrecasteaux

</example>

#### Punctuation

Hyphens and apostrophes can be part of an official name. They appear if they
were part of the name of the person commemorated by the place name.

<example> 
##### Correct
Baden-Powell Waterhole

</example>

Australian places have official names derived from Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander languages. Some places have official dual names from those languages
and English.

When writing official dual names, use a spaced forward slash to separate the
2 parts of the name. The order should be as written in the official name, which
you can check in the [Australian Place Names
dataset](https://placenames.fsdf.org.au/).

<example> 
* Kata Tjuta / Mount Olga
* Karlu Karlu / Devils Marbles
</example>

Some official Tasmanian place names do not follow the convention of using
initial capitals for proper nouns.

<example> 
* kunanyi / Mount Wellington
</example>

### Use capitals for names of places, roads and streets

Words that don’t usually need an initial capital have one when they are part of
a place name.

<example> 
* the Adelaide Hills
* the North Shore
* the Western District
</example>

The names of roads, streets and other thoroughfares also take an initial
capital.

<example> 
* George Street
* Wickham Terrace
* Monaro Highway
</example>

This is a similar rule to style for proper names of mountains, valleys, bays,
islands and other [topographic features](/node/135).

### Use shortened forms for addresses

Addresses usually have abbreviations and contractions. Do not add punctuation
marks to these.

<example> 
* 10 Bendemeer Blvd
* PO Box 1 RMB 99
</example>

Common abbreviations include:

* Av (Avenue)
* Cct (Circuit)
* Cr (Crescent)
* Ct (Court)
* Dr (Drive)
* Esp (Esplanade)
* Gr (Grove)
* Hts (Heights)
* Hwy (Highway)
* Pde (Parade)
* Pl (Place)
* Rd (Road)
* St (Street)
* Tce (Terrace).

#### Shortened state and territory names for addresses

When addressing a letter, write the last line in capitals without punctuation or
underlining, with the postcode last. The last line should contain the place name
or post office of delivery, state or territory abbreviation and postcode.

<example> 
11 Banks Av WAGGA WAGGA NSW 2650

</example>

If you are sending mail overseas, spell out all names in the address in full to
avoid confusion.

<example> 
 

‘SA‘ could refer to South Australia or to South Africa.

</example>

### Write the names of buildings, structures and public places with an initial capital

Names of buildings, structures and public places have initial capitals. Write
generic and plural terms in lower case.

<example> 
 

* St Paul’s Cathedral is close to Melbourne’s Federation Square. The cathedral ...
* The Iron Cove and Gladesville bridges are both in Sydney.
</example>

Use initial capitals for the names of private properties.

<example> 
 

* Thargomindah Station
* Myocum Downs
* Tocal Homestead
</example>

### Shorten names for states and territories in 4 situations

Spell out the names of Australian states and territories in formal content.

You can use shortened forms when:

* the name is used as an adjective
* space is limited
* the full name would result in repetition
* you are writing an address.

<example> 
 

The WA Government has reopened the Eyre Highway. [‘WA’ is used as an adjective.]

</example>

Don’t use a full stop after the shortened forms. This rule applies to the
initialisms (NSW, WA, ACT and NT), abbreviations (Vic and Tas) and the
contraction (Qld).

States and territories are generally listed in an order when more than one is
mentioned. For example:

* in alphabetical order (ACT to WA)
* by population size (NSW to NT).

<example> 
#### Example

 

* NSW
* Vic
* Qld
* WA
* SA
* Tas
* ACT
* NT
</example>

Other orders might be more suitable for some content. For example, content might
include a list of states and territories ordered by total annual rainfall or
number of enrolled voters. Use the order that fits with context and helps people
understand your content.

## Commercial terms

Brands and model names are protected by law. Unless using common names, write
trade mark names and use symbols so people can understand legal status.

### Use initial capitals for commercial terms

Use initial capitals for trade marks, brands and business names.

<example>
* Collins Class submarine
* Harley-Davidson
* Instagram</example>

An exception to using initial capitals is where the business itself uses an
unusual mix of spacing, capitals and lower case letters. In this case, write it
the way the business writes it.

<example>
* iPhone
* nbn
* UNIX
* X
* YouTube</example>

Don’t use an initial capital at the start of sentences when the trade mark or
brand starts with a lower case letter.

<example>
eBay is a popular online auction site.</example>

Use initial capitals for the proprietary names of drugs and other chemicals, but
lower case for generic names.

<example>
Celestone V [Proprietary name] – hydrocortisone [Generic name]

Panadol [Proprietary name] – paracetamol [Generic name]</example>

#### Spelling of ‘trade mark’

‘Trade mark’ is spelled as 2 words in the [Trade Marks Act
1995](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04969). Use this spelling when
writing for government, even though most dictionaries prefer ‘trademark’.

<example>
The trade mark Vegemite was first registered in 1923.</example>

You should also spell ‘trade mark’ as 2 words when you use it as a verb,
although it’s better to say ‘register a trade mark’.

<example>
Trade mark your brand if you don’t want other organisations or businesses to use
it.

Register your brand as a trade mark if you don’t want others to use it.</example>

### Use a common word for a product if you can

Avoid using trade marks and brand names if possible. Instead use a generic word.

<example>
* tissue
* cooler</example>

#### The ® and ™ symbols

Avoid using the registered (®) symbol or the trade mark (™) symbol for trade
marks if possible.

The registered symbol shows a trade mark is registered. A business doesn’t have
to use the symbol for protecting its intellectual property. It’s illegal to use
it if the trade mark is not registered.

The trade mark symbol can be used with registered and unregistered trade marks.
Businesses can use it when they intend to register the term or when registration
is pending. The symbol doesn’t protect the intellectual property of the trade
mark.

Find more guidance in the [Australian Government intellectual property
manual](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

### Take care using product names

The way a trade mark or brand is written is part of the intellectual property of
its owner. Trade mark owners sometimes take legal action to prevent names being
used in a generic sense.

If a term is still registered as a trade mark, you should use it only for that
brand and use a capital letter. This may vary between different countries.

It’s more difficult when brands are becoming generic terms but are also still
used as trade marks. ‘Thermos’ and ‘Hoover’ are examples.

Dictionaries show the way such words are used. Don’t rely on dictionaries to
work out if such words have legal status as trade marks.

Find out if a trade mark has been registered in Australia by using [Australian
trade mark
search](https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/search/quick). If you’re
not sure, seek legal advice.

#### A product name can change meaning when used in the generic sense

A few words have different meanings when used as a trade mark or used
generically.

<example>

##### 

* Band-Aid [A sticking plaster; initial capitals only for that brand]
* bandaid [A word meaning a temporary or makeshift solution to a problem]
* Google [A popular search engine; initial capital only for that brand]
* google [A verb meaning to search on the internet using a search engine]</example>

Other brand names have become so widely used that they are no longer associated
with a specific product. They have become common household names used in a
generic sense. They start with lower case except at the start of a sentence.

<example>
* aspirin
* elevator
* dry ice
* linoleum
* trampoline</example>

## Government terms

Use the correct term and follow the rules for capitalising government terms.
People find it easier to understand content that has a consistent style.

### Use initial capitals for formal names and titles

Use initial capitals only for the formal names and titles of government entities
and office holders. Use lower case for generic references.

These are rules for general content. There might be exceptions if you are
writing specialist legal content using terms defined in legislation.

This page orders guidance for common government terms alphabetically.

#### Australian Government

Refer to the national government of Australia as the ‘Australian Government’.
Use an initial capital for both words only when they occur together.

<example> 
The Australian Government coordinates emergency management with the states.

Australian Government Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources

The advertised grants are funded by the Australian Government. The government
recently extended the closing date for applications.

</example>

#### Bench

In general content, use lower case for the ‘bench’ and ‘full bench’.

<example> 
She was elevated to the bench.

The High Court hears cases that require a full bench.

</example>

#### Budget

Use an initial capital for ‘the Budget’ to show the difference from the generic
reference.

<example> 
People on lower incomes will receive tax relief in this year’s Budget.

Just like the federal Budget was deferred in 2020, so too were state budgets.

</example>

Use lower case for ‘budget’ when it is used as an adjective or as a plural.

<example> 
* budget provisions
* the budgetary process
* successive federal budgets
</example>

#### Cabinet

Always use an initial capital for ‘the Cabinet’ to show the difference from its
generic reference.

<example> 
It was a decision by the Cabinet.

</example>

#### Commonwealth

‘The Commonwealth of Australia’ is the name of Australia in the
[Constitution](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004Q00685). Use an
initial capital for ‘Commonwealth’.

Do not use the phrase ‘Commonwealth government’ to mean ‘Australian Government’.

<example> 
* Defence is an Australian Government responsibility under the Constitution.
* The Commonwealth marine area is any part of the sea between 3 and 200 nautical miles from the coast.
</example>

#### Crown

Always use an initial capital for ‘the Crown’ to show the difference from its
generic reference.

<example> 
The Governor-General is appointed by the Crown.

</example>

#### Departments and agencies

Use initial capital letters only for the formal names of government departments
and agencies. Check the names of departments and agencies in the [government
online directory](https://www.directory.gov.au/).

Don’t use capital letters for generic mentions. For example, use:

* ‘the agency’ instead of ‘the Agency’
* ‘the authority’ instead of ‘the Authority’
* ‘the commission’ instead of ‘the Commission’
* ‘the department’ instead of ‘the Department’.

Use a shortened form of the name only if the department or agency uses it
regularly in their own content.

If you cite a source written by an organisation that has since changed its name,
use the name published in the source. This might not be the organisation’s
current name.
<example> 
 

The Department of Finance owns the policy. The department has been working on it
for months.

</example>

Always use an initial capital for ‘the Treasury’ to show the difference from its
generic reference.

<example> 
 

The Treasury conducts itself to the highest standards.

</example>

Use initial capitals for the formal names of areas in a department or agency's
organisational structure. Don't use initial capitals for generic mentions of
parts of the formal names.

<example> 
 

The Budget Policy Division is part of Treasury’s Fiscal Group. The division
coordinates the delivery of the Budget and other fiscal reports.

</example>

#### Federal

Use an initial capital letter for ‘federal’ when it forms part of a formal name.
Don’t capitalise it when it is used as an adjective.

<example> 
 

* the Federal Court of Australia
* federal issues
</example>

#### Federation

Use an initial capital for the word ‘federation’ only when referring to
Australia’s Federation in 1901.

<example> 
 

The design of Australia’s national flag is the result of a competition announced
to coincide with Federation in 1901.

The type of architecture popular between 1890 and 1915 is known as
Federation style architecture.

</example>

#### Government

Use an initial capital for the word ‘government’ if it is part of a formal name.
Use lower case everywhere else.

<example> 
##### Example

 

* the Victorian Government
* the Australian and New Zealand governments
* the governments of South Australia and Tasmania
* Road maintenance is a local government responsibility.
</example>

#### Government programs and agreements

Use initial capitals for the full names of:

* government programs
* treaties
* protocols and similar agreements.

Use initial capitals for abbreviations that remain specific but not for generic
references or abbreviations.

<example> 
##### Example

 

* the Greater Artesian Basin Sustainability Initiative
* the Artesian Basin Initiative
* the initiative
</example>

#### Heads of state and prime ministers

Use initial capitals for the formal and abbreviated titles of current heads of
state.

<example> 
##### Example

 

The Prime Minister announced the new initiative this morning.

The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom chairs Cabinet meetings.

The Sultan of Oman comes from a dynasty of rulers. The Sultan met with the Prime
Minister last week.

</example>

You do not need to use capitals for generic references to the position or when
referring to previous incumbents.

<example> 
##### Example

 

Sir Edmund Barton was the first prime minister of Australia.

Justin Trudeau is the eldest son of former Canadian prime minister Pierre
Trudeau.

</example>

#### Legislation

Use government sources to check the titles of legislation, especially:

* the [Federal Register of Legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Home)
* the Australian Parliament House list of [bills and legislation](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation).

Follow the [guidance in this manual to use the correct title for
legislation](/node/163).

Use initial capitals for these terms when referring to specific legislation:

* Act
* Ordinance
* Regulation
* Bill.

Use lower case for generic references to bills, regulations and ordinances. Use
initial capitals for all references to Acts.

Follow [detailed rules for references to delegated legislation](/node/210).

<example> 
##### Example

 

The Act separated legal ties between the 2 entities. [A short-hand reference to
an Act]

The bills were rejected for the second time. [A generic reference to a set of
bills]

</example>

#### Ministers and departmental secretaries

Use initial capitals for the official titles of ministers and departmental
secretaries. Use lower case for generic references.

<example> 
 

The Minister for Education announced the new policy. Education groups met with
the minister to present their views.

The Secretary of the Department of Social Services gave the opening address.
Several secretaries attended the forum.

</example>

Apply this rule to the titles of other government office holders and department
officials.

<example> 
##### Example

 

* Our local member is Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister.
* Assistant ministers are designated as parliamentary secretaries under the Ministers of State Act 1952.
* The Deputy Secretary of Policy and Programs was one of 5 deputy secretaries to attend the interdepartmental committee meeting.
* She will take on the role of first assistant secretary responsible for overseeing engagement with external stakeholders.
</example>

##### Correct prepositions

Always use ‘for’ (not ‘of’) for a minister’s portfolio.

Generally, use ‘of’ for anyone working at a department or agency.

<example> 
 

* the Minister for Education
* Secretary of the Department of Health.
</example>

#### Principals of Australian institutions

In many cases, you need to use initial capitals for the official titles of the
principals and chief executives of Australian institutions. Check a dictionary
or reliable reference if you are unsure of the correct title and format.

<example> 
##### Example

 

* the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia
* the Attorney-General
* The Secretary of the Department of Social Services
* the Vice-Chancellor and President of the University of Queensland
* the Premier of New South Wales
* the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory
</example>

Use lower case for most of these titles in general references that do not refer
to a specific person.

<example> 
##### Example

 

* The average salaries of vice-chancellors have reached a new high.
* Several attorneys-general met to discuss the issue last week.
* The premiers of New South Wales and Victoria met to discuss health reforms.
</example>

#### States and territories

To refer to an Australian state or territory:

* Use initial capitals for words in the formal name.
* Use lower case for generic or plural references.

<example> 
##### Example

 

* The Australian Capital Territory has a land border length of 306 kilometres. The territory’s total area is more than 2,000 square kilometres.
* The South Australian Government started the project. The government will meet regularly to review progress.
* The states and territories are responsible for health care and education.
</example>

Few situations will require you to use the [shortened form for a state or
territory](/node/134##shorten_names_for_states_and_territories_in_4_situations).

##### ‘Territory’ is an exception when used for the Northern Territory

‘Territory’ is a semi-official term for the Northern Territory. Use a capital
‘T’ when using ‘Territory’ instead of the full name for the Northern Territory.
Use lower case for generic references.

<example> 
###### Example

 

The Northern Territory road toll is a concern to the territory. [Initial
capitals for the full name; lower case for a generic reference]

The Territory is a common destination for overseas tourists. [The semi-official
term instead of the full name]

</example>

#### Parliamentary terms

Use initial capitals for formal names connected with parliament. Generic
references are in lower case.

<example> 
##### Example

 

* Parliament House
* the Parliamentary Library
* The problem was raised in the Queensland Parliament.
* There was a change to parliamentary procedures.
</example>

Use initial capitals for the formal titles of parliamentary office holders.
These include:

* Clerk of the House
* Clerk of the Senate
* Leader of the Government in the Senate
* Manager of Opposition Business
* President of the Senate
* Speaker of the House
* Serjeant-at-Arms
* Usher of the Black Rod.

<example> 
##### Example

 

Senator Lines is the Deputy President and Chair of Committees in the 46th
Parliament.

</example>

Use initial capitals for the formal titles of current members of parliament.

<example> 
##### Example

 

* Mr Adam Bandt MP
* Senator Pauline Hanson
* They met with Senator Griff.
</example>

Use lower case for parliamentary terms that are not formal titles. These words
include:

* member of parliament; members of parliament
* senator; senators
* member; members
* frontbench; frontbencher
* backbench; backbencher
* crossbench; crossbencher.

<example> 
##### Example

 

She moved from the backbench to take the new ministerial portfolio.

He was a former senator for Tasmania, serving from 1947 to 1951.

</example>

##### The houses of the Australian, state and territory parliaments

Always use initial capital letters to refer to:

* the Senate
* the House of Representatives
* the corresponding bodies in the states and territories.

<example> 
###### Example

 

The Senate referred the matter to the Senate Community Affairs References
Committee.

The Legislative Assembly will vote on the matter tomorrow. The Assembly has been
debating the matter for months.

</example>

The Senate and the House of Representatives are the ‘houses of parliament’, in
lower case.

Use ‘the House’, ‘this House’, ‘lower house’ or ‘people’s house’ to refer to the
House of Representatives.

Use ‘this house’, ‘upper house’, ‘house of review’ or ‘states’ house’ to refer
to the Senate.

## Medical terms

Medical terms have specific meanings. Introduce scientific terms and common
names if that helps users, but always use the correct spelling and style.

### Use capitals for proper nouns and genus names

Use an initial capital letter for medical terms only if the term is a proper
noun or adjective, or if it is the name of a genus. Otherwise don’t use initial
capitals for the names of:

* diseases and viruses
* diagnostic procedures
* syndromes
* anatomical parts.

<example> 
* hepatitis B
* Hendra virus
* foot-and-mouth disease
* Golgi apparatus
* Tourette syndrome
* computed tomography
* colon
</example>

#### Shortened forms

Use capital letters for acronyms and initialisms of medical terms. Spell out the
full term in lower case, unless the word or term you’re shortening includes a
proper name or a genus name.

<example> 
* acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
* drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) disease
* sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
* intensive care unit (ICU)
* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
</example>

#### Spelling for eponyms

Some terms are named after the people who discovered, studied or described the
specific anatomical part or disease. Other terms are named after people who had
a particular disease.

All of these terms are called ‘eponyms’. Eponyms appear as different types of
adjectives in medical terms. They are usually possessive adjectives.

When referring to an eponym in writing, use the following rules:

* If it is a disease named after people who had the disease, use the possessive case.
* If it is a disease or anatomical part named after the person who discovered, studied or described it, don’t use the possessive case.

<example> 
* Lou Gehrig’s disease [Named after Lou Gehrig, a high-profile person who had the disease]
* Legionnaires’ disease [Named after members of the American Legion – known as Legionnaires – who were the first documented people to have the disease]
* Alzheimer disease [Named after Dr Alois Alzheimer, who first described the disease]
* Down syndrome [Named after Dr John L H Down, who first described the syndrome]
* Henle loop [Anatomical part named after anatomist Gustav Jakob Henle]
</example>

This rule doesn’t apply to names of organisations dedicated to studying certain
diseases or supporting people who are affected by them. Always refer to
organisations in the same way as they refer to themselves.

<example> 
* Alzheimer’s Association
* Crohn’s & Colitis Australia
</example>

### Italicise organism names

Write scientific names of infectious organisms – such as viruses, bacteria and
parasites – in italics. Use an initial capital for the name of the genus only.

<example> 
The bacterium Legionella pneumophila causes Legionnaires’ disease. [Legionella
is the name of the genus and pneumophila is the species.]

</example>

### Cite common names for pharmaceutical drugs, not brand names

Use the generic names of drugs where possible. Write them in lower case.

You can include the brand name in parentheses after the common name. Use initial
capitals for brand names. Commercial terms might be trade marked: take care
[using product names](/node/89##take_care_using_product_names).

<example> 
* benzoyl peroxide (Benzac)
* paracetamol (Panadol)
</example>

### Refer to medical conditions using clear and inclusive language

The language you use for some medical conditions can change as research and
social understanding of the conditions evolve. Be mindful of outdated language
that can perpetuate stigma or misunderstandings about the condition.

Refer to peak bodies that study the condition or that provide support and
information to people affected by it.

<example> 
The term ‘bipolar disorder’ replaces ‘manic depression’, a term that is no
longer in use.

</example>

When you are writing about people with a medical condition, focus on the person.
Use neutral language to describe the condition. Don’t label the person.

<example> 
* a person with cancer
* people with asthma
* a person with diabetes
</example>

If you’re writing both the scientific and common names for a medical condition,
place the scientific name in parentheses. Don’t use ‘or’. This could confuse
readers into thinking they are 2 separate medical conditions.

<example> 
 

People with pneumonia-like infections might have Legionnaires’ disease
(legionellosis).

</example>

## Nationalities, peoples and places outside Australia

Refer to peoples and places outside Australia based on current information.
Correct spelling and style avoids causing confusion or offence among users.

### Check official sources for country and place names

Some countries have several official names. Consult trusted references to decide
which name to use, then use it consistently. Helpful references include:

* the [countries, economies and regions](https://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/pages/countries-and-regions) webpages, on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website
* the United Nations [geographical names database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/geonames/)
* the Australian Bureau of Statistics [Standard Australian classification of countries](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1269.0Main+Features102016?OpenDocument).

<example> 
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is often called the
‘United Kingdom’.

</example>

The names of countries can change for political reasons. For example, a country
might change its name to show independence from a former occupying country.

<example> 
The Democratic Republic of the Congo used to be called ‘Zaire’. The former name
came from the Portuguese colonial name for the Congo River.

</example>

Country boundaries can also change.

### Spell country names with a capital letter

Use initial capitals for:

* the official name of a country
* any commonly used short forms of the country’s name
* the names of states, territories and provinces.

The definite article ‘the’ isn’t capitalised unless it begins a sentence.

<example> 
* the Cayman Islands – the Caymans
* the Falkland Islands – the Falklands
</example>

### Shorten a country name only if it is clear to the user

Use a short form of a country’s name only if it’s clear and accurate. Shortened
forms can make it easier to read text or tables, illustrations, notes, lists and
bibliographies.

<example> 
‘North Korea’ is the shortened form of the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea.

</example>

### Use English versions of countries and places in most content

English-language content usually uses the English version of a country’s name.

<example> 
* ‘Socialist Republic of Vietnam’ is the English version of Cộng hòa xã hội chủ nghĩa Việt Nam.
* ‘Germany’ is the English version of Deutschland.
* ‘New Zealand’ is the English version of Aotearoa.
* ‘The Czech Republic’ or ‘Czechia’ are the English versions of Česká republika.
</example>

There are some cases where the preferred official name isn’t in English.

<example> 
* ‘Côte d’Ivoire’ is the preferred official name for the Ivory Coast.
* ‘Eswatini’ is the preferred name for Swaziland.
</example>

In English-speaking countries, the convention is to use the established English
forms for well-known place names.

<example> 
* Beijing
* Krakow
* Rome
* Brussels
* Florence
* Pyongyang
* the Hague
</example>

When the name is used generically, you don’t need an initial capital.

<example> 
* brussels sprout [A type of sprout, not a sprout from Brussels]
* venetian blind [A type of screen for a window, not a blind from Venice]
* french door [A type of door, not a door from France]
</example>

### Check the official status for area and region names

Groups of nations or areas that are recognised as political or geographic
regions take initial capitals.

<example> 
 

* South-East Asia
* Central America
* the Balkans
</example>

Use lower case if the names of compass points (such as north and south-east) are
not part of the name but are used to refer to the geographic area.

<example> 
 

* southern Germany
* northern Iraq
</example>

Some names that aren’t officially recognised become well known and gain a
semi-official status. Use a dictionary to help you decide when this is
appropriate.

<example> 
#### Example

 

Kurdistan

</example>

### Write nationalities, peoples and places with initial capitals

There’s usually a clear relationship between the name of the country or region
and the word used for the nationality. It’s not always obvious though, so check
a dictionary to ensure you’re using the correct term.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* Türkiye – Turkish
* Melanesia – Melanesian
* the Philippines – Filipino
* Congo – Congolese
* United Arab Emirates – Emirati
* New Zealand – New Zealander
</example>

Follow guidance for writing non-English [personal names](/node/90).

Capitalise the names of certain groups.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* People groups – Hispanic, Sentinelese, Vietnamese Rục, Sámi
* Clans – Clan Campbell (Scottish)
* People from particular regions – Asian, European, Sumatran, Basque
* People who follow particular religions – Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Greek Orthodox
* People who speak particular languages – Hokkien-speaking
</example>

### Check if an official language differs from the country name

The name of a country’s language isn’t always derived from the name of the
country.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* The people of Iran speak Farsi.
* Dari and Pashto are the official languages of Afghanistan.
* While Chileans speak Spanish, Brazilians speak Portuguese.
* East Timor has 2 official languages: Portuguese and Tetum.
</example>

## Natural phenomena

Treat terms for climate and weather events with consistent style. It helps users
scan content for keywords and supports readability.

### Standard rules of capitalisation apply for most natural phenomena

Follow the rules of capitalisation for most natural phenomena:

* Proper nouns start with a capital letter.
* Adjectives and common nouns are in lower case.

Do not use italics.

### Most terms are usually in lower case

Write generic terms for climate and weather in lower case. This rule applies to
many compound nouns.

<example> 
climate change, global warming, greenhouse gases

</example>

Specific terms usually take lower case. For example, this rule applies to
scientific names for types of clouds.

<example> 
cumulonimbus, cirrus and stratus

</example>

### Terms for specific phenomena can take initial capitals

Scientific terms for natural phenomena can include common nouns that combine to
form a proper noun.

Use initial capitals when spelling out this kind of scientific term. Common
shortened forms are in full capitals. Any non-English names retain the spelling
of the original.

<example> 
* Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)
* Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)
</example>

### Climate and weather events take on proper names

Individual climate and weather events have names to help communicate the event
to the public.

There are specific capitalisation rules for climate and weather events. We
follow the style recommended by Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology.

For events not listed here, follow the standard rules for capitalisation.

#### Cyclones are usually given people’s names

Use initial capitals for the names of cyclones.

Do this for the given name and for the adjectives and common nouns that appear
immediately before the given name. The bureau uses ‘Cyclone’, ‘Tropical Cyclone’
and ‘Severe Tropical Cyclone’ as part of the cyclone’s name.

Check the name is accurate on the [bureau’s website](http://www.bom.gov.au/).

Use the same rule for hurricanes and typhoons. These are different terms for the
same natural phenomenon.

<example> 
* Cyclone Yasi
* Tropical Cyclone Winifred
* Severe Tropical Cyclone Damien
* Hurricane Wilma
* Typhoon Fengshen
</example>

Always write ‘Cyclone’ as part of the name unless it is clear from the
surrounding text that you are referring to a cyclone.

<example> 
Hilda was the first cyclone in the Australian region to make landfall in the
2017–18 season.

Cyclone Hilda made landfall in the 2017–18 season.

</example>

#### Droughts are usually named after a period in time

If the time is a formal period, the name has an initial capital.

<example> 
* Millennium drought
* Federation drought
* the 1982–83 major drought
</example>

#### Fires are usually named for a time or location

Bushfires take initial capitals for the adjectival part of their name as well as
any proper noun. Fires leading to substantial loss of life and property are
usually named after the worst day or where they started.

<example> 
* State Mine fire (New South Wales, 2013)
* Black Saturday bushfires (Victoria, 2009)
* Ash Wednesday bushfires (Victoria and South Australia, 1983)
* Black Tuesday bushfires (Tasmania, 1967)
* Black Friday bushfires (Victoria and New South Wales, 1939)
* Black Thursday bushfires (Victoria, 1851)
</example>

During a fire, authorities usually name a fire based on where it started.

<example> 
the Taylors Creek Road fire

</example>

#### Floods, earthquakes and tsunamis are named by year, location and event

Use ‘year Location event’ as the naming convention for floods, earthquakes and
tsunamis. Only the location (the proper noun) has an initial capital.

<example> 
 

* 1974 Brisbane flood
* 1989 Newcastle earthquake
* 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami
</example>

## Organisation names

Spell and punctuate organisation names correctly. This helps people to
understand your content.

### Write the name as the organisation writes it

Organisations determine how their names should be spelt and punctuated. This
does not always follow the usual rules.

Write the name of the organisation the same way the organisation writes it. This
rule applies except in rare cases when the organisation name is in all lower
case. Use an initial capital for these names in body text. This helps people
identify the name as a proper noun.

Some names start with a lower case letter but have a medial capital (for
example, ‘eBay’). Write the name the same way, including to begin a sentence. A
medial capital is enough to identify the name as a proper noun.

<example> 
eSafety keeps tips on its website topical and up to date.

</example>

Pay attention to the use of capital letters, punctuation (such as apostrophes)
and logograms (such as ‘&’). Make sure to include all words in the name. Don’t
add additional words.

<example> 
* United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ['United Nations’ doesn't have an apostrophe because it is [descriptive](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-conventions/punctuation-marks/apostrophes##descriptive_phrases_dont_need_apostrophes). Note the variant spelling of ‘Organization’.]
* Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) [The ampersand is part of the initialism but not the spelt-out form.]
* State Library Victoria [The name is not the ‘State Library of Victoria’. It does not include a preposition.]
* Meat & Livestock Australia [The ampersand is part of the name.]
</example>

### Check the correct name of an organisation

The names of organisations can change. The most efficient way to confirm an
organisation’s name is to check its website, annual report or letterhead. If
this is unsuccessful, there are other reliable services.
For Australian Government entities, use the [government online
directory](https://www.directory.gov.au/). Directory entries contain links to
departmental pages listing annual reports. Annual reports are a good way to find
the former names of departments.

The government online directory includes the Australian Government Organisations
Register and the directories of state and territory governments. There are also
website directories for some local governments.

For non-government entities, use:

* the Australian Securities Exchange's [listed companies](https://www.asx.com.au/asx/research/listedCompanies.do)
* the [Australian Securities and Investments Commission registers](https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/SearchRegisters.jspx?_adf.ctrl-state=p64f240em_12)

For all entities, use:

* the Australian Business Register's [ABN lookup](https://abr.business.gov.au/)
* a publication that lists organisations such as the Directory of Australian associations or Margaret Gee’s media guide, if your organisation has access.

<example> 
Before September 2013, the Department of Social Services was called the
‘Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs’.

</example>

If you cite a source written by an organisation that has since changed its name,
use the name that was published in the source. This may be the organisation’s or
[government department's past
name](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-conventions/referencing-and-attribution/author-date##order_the_elements_of_each_item_in_a_reference_list).

#### Capital letters in registered business names

Some organisation names appearing on the Australian Business Register have all
capitals. Our first rule applies: write the name as the organisation does.

Check the organisation's website and publications to find how it capitalises its
name and follow the organisation's preferred style.

<example> 
MySA GOV [All capitals for 'GOV' is the preferred style. The registered business
name has the same capitalisation.]

The Smith Family [Initial capitals is the preferred style. The registered
business name is 'THE SMITH FAMILY' in all capitals.]

</example>

#### Shortened forms of the name

Use the organisation’s shortened form only if the organisation regularly uses it
in its own content.

For example, the Department of Home Affairs uses ‘Home Affairs’ as the shortened
form. It would be inappropriate to use ‘DHA’ to refer to Home Affairs. However,
Defence Housing Australia does use the initialism ‘DHA’, so using it to refer to
that organisation would be appropriate.

Spell out the shortened form the first time, unless the organisation’s name is
known only by the shortened form.

<example> 
* Zoning laws allowed IKEA to lease the land.
* Defence Housing Australia (DHA) provides housing for Defence members and their families. DHA also provides other related services.
</example>

#### Shortened forms as part of the name

Some organisations use shortened forms such as ‘Ltd’, ‘Pty Ltd’, ‘Co’ and
‘Inc’ as part of their legal name. Others use the spelt-out forms.

Don't add a full stop at the end of ‘Co’ and ‘Inc’ unless they finish a
sentence. No full stop is the correct Australian Government style for
[abbreviations](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/format-writing-and-structure/clear-language-and-writing-style/plain-language-and-word-choice/abbreviations##dont_put_a_full_stop_after_most_abbreviations).

<example> 

* Apple Inc
* Woodside Petroleum Ltd
* Perpetual Limited
</example>

Use the organisation’s full title on first mention in a publication. On
subsequent mentions in print documents, you can omit words like ‘proprietary’
and ‘limited’ and the corresponding shortened forms.

### Capitalise organisations’ names in 2 situations

Use initial capitals for:

* all words capitalised in the full, official names of organisations
* the first mention of an organisation.

Don’t use an initial capital for:

* generic terms – such as ‘the department’ or ‘the agency’ – even if the organisation being referenced capitalises the generic term in its content
* mentions of several organisations with the same generic name.

<example> 
* Australian Academy of the Humanities – the academy
* Department of Finance – the department
* The departments of Health and Finance – the departments
* Western Sydney University – the university
* Australian Ballet Company – the company
* Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry – the royal commission
* Gundagai Shire Council – the shire council/the council
* Regional Australia Summit – the summit
</example>

#### In body text, use lower case for the definite article in the names of organisations

Some organisations use the definite article ‘The’ in their name with an initial
capital. Use the full name, including ‘The’, in 2 situations:

* in [emails and letters](/node/50)
* if the name appears in an alphabetical list (arrange by ‘The’ as the first word in the name).

Always use lower case ‘the’ in body text. This follows the practice of most
organisations.

<example> 
The University of Sydney [Correct name, not ‘University of Sydney’]

Next year the University of Sydney will renovate its science buildings. [Body
text uses lower case for ‘the’]

</example>

If organisations omit the definite article from their name, don’t use it in
emails and letters. In body text, ‘the’ appears before the correct name or isn’t
needed at all.

<example> 
 

Charles Sturt University [Correct name, not ‘The Charles Sturt University’]

Research at Charles Sturt University examined whether early Australian wheat
varieties caused allergic reactions. [Body text does not use ‘the’]

</example>

### Put a possessive apostrophe in a name if the organisation does

Use an apostrophe only when it forms part of the official name of an
organisation.

<example> 
 

Actors’ and Entertainers’ Benevolent Fund Qld

</example>

In all other cases for organisation names, don’t use [possessive
apostrophes](/node/106).

The apostrophe is disappearing from many organisational names, particularly from
those that contain plural nouns ending in ‘s’. In these cases, the plural noun
is descriptive rather than possessive.

<example> 
 

* Australian Securities and Investments Commission
* Libraries Board of South Australia
* Minerals Council of Australia
* Chief Government Geologists Conference
* Australian Workers Union
</example>

### Use the singular verb with organisation names

The rules of grammar allow the use of a plural or singular verb with the names
of organisations. This is not Australian Government style.

Always use a singular verb. This applies even if organisation names end in an
‘s’ and look plural.

<example> 
 

* The Bureau of Meteorology has been quick to respond.
* Woolworths is advertising its new stock.
* The United Nations turns 75 in 2020.
* NT Fisheries has reviewed its policies.
</example>

## Personal names

Getting personal names right is respectful. It also helps users avoid any
confusion. Check that you’ve used the correct spelling, punctuation and
capitalisation.

### Use the right name

When you write to or about people, always use the form of personal name that the
person uses. If you can, ask the person which name they prefer. Otherwise,
consult reputable sources for:

* Names of people who work within government or in roles related to government, including state and territory governments: [Directory.gov.au](https://www.directory.gov.au/).
* Records of names of people closely associated with Australia: The [National Archives of Australia](https://www.naa.gov.au/help-your-research/getting-started/commonwealth-record-series-crs-system).
* Historical and biographical information: The [Australian dictionary of biography](http://adb.anu.edu.au/) and [Trove](https://trove.nla.gov.au/).
* Information on prominent Australians, search ‘eResources’ such as Who’s who in Australia or Encyclopedia Britannica: [National Library of Australia](https://www.nla.gov.au/).
* The accepted form of authors’ names and the names of people being written about: library catalogues.

Names are important to a person’s sense of self. To avoid cultural or gender
bias when referring to parts of names, use:

* ‘given name’ instead of ‘Christian name’
* ‘family name’ instead of ‘surname’
* ‘previous names’ instead of ‘maiden name’.

### Use initial capitals for personal names, initials and nicknames

Use initial capitals for the names of real and fictitious people.

<example> 
* Oodgeroo Noonuccal
* Clive James
* Minjee Lee
* Miles Franklin
* Fiona Katauskas
* Beatie Bow
* King O’Malley
</example>

Capitalise the initials of people’s given names. Write them unspaced and without
full stops. Use non-breaking spaces to ensure that initials are not separated
from family names.

<example> 
* W Aly
* Ken G Hall
* AD Hope
* J-P Bruneteau [Hyphen is part of the individual’s given name, Jean-Paul]
</example>

Use initial capitals for nicknames. The first time they appear in your text,
place nicknames in quotation marks.

<example> 
* ‘Madame Butterfly’ [Swimmer, Susie O’Neill]
* ‘Blocker’ [Rugby League player, Steve Roach]
* ‘Million Dollar Mermaid’ [Annette Kellerman, swimmer, diver and film star]
* ‘Maj’ [Majak Daw, the first Sudanese-born AFL footballer]
* ‘The Little Digger’ [Former prime minister, Sir William Hughes]
</example>

Be aware that a few people don’t use capitals for their names. This is a
deliberate style decision that is part of their personal identity. Examples
include bell hooks and kd lang. Use the form the person uses.

### Spell plural forms correctly

The plural of any personal name is formed by adding ‘s’ or ‘es’. It depends on
the spelling of the personal name (Table 1).

Table 1: How to make a plural form of a nameNames ending inAction to make pluralExamples‘s’, ‘x’ and ‘z’Add ‘es’There were 3 Yanises and 2 Lizes at the meeting but no Alexes.‘y’Keep the ‘y’ and add ‘s’The Murphys always meet on Tuesdays.‘i’Keep the ‘i’ and add ‘s’The 2 Ranis were close colleagues.‘o’Add an ‘s’The 4 young Angelos played together all day.All other lettersAdd an ‘s’The 2 Evelyns in the section were cousins.

### Punctuate possessive forms with an apostrophe

Use an apostrophe and an ‘s’ with personal names, even when they already end in
‘s’ (Table 2).

Plural personal names take just an apostrophe. Simply add an apostrophe to the
end of the plural form.

Table 2: How to show the possessive form for names and for pronoun combinationsNumberNames ending inAction to show possessive caseExamplesSingular (one person)‘s’Add apostrophe ‘s’ (’s)Jas’s reportSingular (one person)Any letter other than ‘s’Add apostrophe ‘s’ (’s)Tui’s signaturePlural (2 or more people of the same name)The plural ‘s’ or ‘es’Add only an apostrophe (’) without an extra ‘s’The Joneses’ responses or the Nasrins’ name tagsPlural (2 or more people of a different name)Any letter other than ‘s’Add only an apostrophe ‘s’ (’s) on the last nameAiko and Tashi’s teamPlural (2 or more people using singular pronoun and possessive pronoun with a noun)Any letter other than ‘s’Add only an apostrophe ‘s’ (’s) on the nounYou and your partner’s luggage

### Keep hyphens and all parts of compound family names

Always retain hyphens when you write given and family names that are hyphenated.

<example> 
* Kath Day-Knight
* Alen-Igor O’Hran
</example>

Write all parts of compound family names. Keep the compound when writing a
person’s family name.

<example> 
William Delafield Cook [‘Delafield Cook’ is a compound name.]

</example>

Sometimes someone has more than one family name but is only known by one. Write
all the names the first time and use the well-known family name after.

<example> 
Mary Morton Allport [The artist is known as ‘Allport’.]

</example>

To decide which name to use, ask the person if you can. Otherwise, check works
they have written, personal correspondence from them or reliable sources about
them.

### Follow reliable sources for non-English names

As far as possible, if you need to write a non-English name, use the same form
and spelling as the person uses. Check their personal correspondence or works
they have written. If you can, ask them how you should address them. As a last
resort, use the name that is most commonly used in writing about the person.

#### Pay attention to the order of names

The order of names is culturally based. In many English-speaking countries, the
order of a name is given name then family name. However, other cultures use
family names first.

Some people change the order of their name when they move countries.

If you can, ask the person which name is their family name and how they would
prefer to be addressed. Follow guidance for how to write about [nationalities,
peoples and places outside Australia](/node/133).

<example> 
Chinese–Australian economist Professor Xiaokai Yang was born Yang Xiguang. Yang
is his family name. He changed his given name to Xiaokai after being released
from prison in China. He is known by Xiaokai Yang in the US and Australia, but
as Yang Xiaokai in China.

</example>

#### Keep accents and diacritic marks in names

Given and family names sometimes have diacritic marks or symbols, including
accents, such as à, á, â, ã, ä, ė, ē, ĕ, ę.

When you write names, retain diacritic marks unless the person commonly uses a
simplified form of their name.

Insert diacritic marks into your document with the [Unicode
Standard](https://www.unicode.org/charts/) – for example, U+00E8 is è. In word
processing applications, you can also use the [ASCII extended character
set](https://www.ascii-code.com).

<example> 
* Renée Geyer
* Jirí Václav Daneš
* Faddéj Faddéevič Bellinsgáuzen [Romanised Russian form] – Fabian Bellingshausen [English form]
* Nguyễn Thu Giang [Vietnamese form] – Giang Thu Nguyen [English form] – Giang Nguyen [Simple form] – GT Nguyen [Initialised form]
* Florens Theodor Reinhard Müller
</example>

#### Treat names with particles case by case

Some family names contain a particle, such as ‘della’, ‘Al’ or ‘von’.

It is sometimes difficult to decide how to capitalise these personal names in
English.

Use the same capitalisation as the person uses. It is largely a matter of
individual preference and family custom. If you can’t ask them, use reliable
resources to decide on a case-by-case basis, then use the same form throughout
the content.

Most, but not all, particles are written in lower case.

<example> 
 

* Kim van Netten
* Thomas de la Condamine
* Julian Van Aalst
* Dame Constance D’Arcy
* Freda Du Faur
</example>

The particle is sometimes omitted when the given name is omitted.

<example> 
 

* Ludwig van Beethoven – Beethoven [The particle is omitted.]
* Richard Di Natale – Di Natale [The particle is included.]
</example>

Always use an initial capital for the particle when a name starts a sentence.
You can also rephrase the sentence to retain the original form.

<example> 
##### Example

 

* Willem van Otterloo was chief conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.
* Van Otterloo was chief conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.
* The chief conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra was van Otterloo.
</example>

### List family name first in reference lists

In a reference list, put the family name first and then the initial for the
given name of the lead author.

Follow the rules for the author–date system to [create an alphabetically ordered
list](/node/165##alphabetise_the_reference_items_in_the_list).

Names you pronounce the same way but spell differently go together in an
alphabetical list.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* MacArthur AB
* M’Cay H
* McFarlane AD
* MacFarlane D

[In this list, all family names are pronounced ‘Mac’. They are ordered as if
they were spelt the same way.]

</example>

## Plants and animals

Names for plants and animals come from classification systems. The right style
for the classification conveys meaning to people reading the content.

### Italicise genus and species names

The genus and species form the definitive name of a plant or animal. By
convention:

* the genus is in italics and takes an initial capital
* the species is in italics and is lower case.

<example> 
Backhousia citriodora is the scientific name of the lemon myrtle.

Ornithorhynchus anatinus is the scientific name of the platypus.

</example>

Subspecies and the names of varieties are also italicised. In these names,
abbreviations for the words ‘subspecies’ and ‘variety’ take a full stop. This is
an exception to the [general rule for
abbreviations](/node/184##dont_put_a_full_stop_after_most_abbreviations).

<example> 
Eucalyptus pauciflora subsp. hedraia is a subspecies of snow gum found only in
the Mount Bogong and Falls Creek areas of Victoria.

Acacia alata var. platyptera is a variety of winged wattle that is found only in
Western Australia.

</example>

#### Accessibility requirements

Screen readers don’t pronounce italics. Use the semantic tag <em> to provide
emphasis for italicised names in HTML.

### Write common names in lower case and roman type

Most plants and animals have a common name as well as their genus and species
name.

For common names:

* Use lower case unless they are also a proper noun, a registered trade mark or in some specialised content such as genetics.
* Do not use italics.

<example> 
* The Tasmanian devil is named after its home range of Tasmania.
* The grasslands were home to more than a million red kangaroos.
* Tuross River was home to a family of platypus.
</example>

Use initial capitals when the name includes a proper noun.

<example> 
* Norfolk Island pine
* Mount Arthur burrowing crayfish
</example>

#### Plant and animal names that are also common English words

Names that have become everyday words are shown in roman type and don’t need a
capital letter.

<example> 
* acacia
* eucalypt
</example>

This includes English derivatives. These are plant and animal names that came
from the scientific classification system and are now in everyday use.

<example> 
* feline [From the subfamily Felinae]
* carnivore [From the order Carnivora]
</example>

You usually don’t need to use an initial capital for breeds, even if they are
derived from a regional name.

<example> 
* labrador
* siamese cat
* friesian cattle
</example>

#### Registered trade marks

Use an initial capital for names of registered cultivars or breeds. In a
sentence, the registered name is sometimes in quotation marks.

<example> 
 

Acacia ‘Cascade’ is a registered cultivar derived from Australian native flora.

</example>

It’s best to check a dictionary or another reputable source to confirm whether
the name has an initial capital. Refer to [related guidance on commercial
terms](/node/89##take_care_using_product_names).

#### Birds (ornithology)

In generalist Australian Government content, use lower case for the names of
birds unless the name contains a proper noun.

<example> 
 

The silver gull (Larus novaehollandiae) is a common gull of the Australian
coast.

South-west Western Australia is the only place where Carnaby’s black cockatoo is
found.

</example>

This style may vary in some specialist content and content following
international conventions. If writing for these, check and use the style that
readers will understand. For example, in some contexts the common names of bird
species start with a capital letter but are lower case when used as a
generic term.

<example> 
 

The Silver Gull (Larus novaehollandiae) is frequently observed in Australian
coastal regions.

A species of cockatoo, Carnaby’s Black Cockatoo, is native to south-west Western
Australia.

</example>

In both generalist and specialist content, use lower case for bird names in a
list of common names of plants and animals.

<example> 
##### Example

 

The area was inhabited by green tree frogs, carpet pythons, bush rats and silver
gulls.

</example>

#### Genetics

When using genetic terms for plants and animals:

* Use italics for the names of genes.
* Use roman type for the names of proteins (enzymes).

Capitalisation varies for the names of genes, but proteins usually take an
initial capital only.

<example> 
##### Example

 

In plants, the gene Sbe1 encodes starch-branching enzyme one, Sbe1.

</example>

### Include the genus and species at first mention of the common name

The common name of a plant or animal can be a local name for more than one
species in different places. Only the scientific name is the definitive name.

For this reason, include the species name in parentheses when you first mention
the common name so it is clear which plant or animal you are writing about.

<example> 
#### Example

 

Royal grevillea (Grevillea victoriae) is one of more than 350 species in the
genus Grevillea.

</example>

A common name is often a local name for a species:

* A common name can be used for several species.
* A species can have different common names in different places.

<example> 
#### Example

 

Black wattle is used as a common name for several Acacia species, such as Acacia
mearnsii, A. aulacocarpa, A. auriculiformis, A. concurrens and A. crassicarpa.

Acacia dealbata is known by several common names, such as ‘silver wattle’, ‘blue
wattle’ and ‘mimosa’.

</example>

#### When the genus is repeated, it can be abbreviated

If you have already written the full name of the genus, use a shortened form for
later mentions. This is often just the first letter of the genus name, followed
by a full stop. This is an exception to the [general rule for
abbreviations](/node/184##dont_put_a_full_stop_after_most_abbreviations).

<example> 
##### Example

 

Ornithorhynchus anatinus belongs to the Ornithorhynchidae family. The elusive
O. anatinus can be spotted in the riparian zone of our freshwater rivers.

</example>

When there are several genera that start with the same letter, include the
second letter in the abbreviation.

<example> 
##### Example

 

Anopterus macleayanus and Aleuries moluccana are small Australian trees.
Although An. macleayanua is found in cool places, Al. moluccana can tolerate
tropical conditions.

</example>

### Refer to classification systems to help you name plants and animals

Plants and animals are classified in a hierarchy from general to specific. The
style you use is set by where the name is in the hierarchy:

* Names down to genus level start with capital letters.
* Species names are in lower case.
* Genus and species names are in italics.

The examples in the table show the classification for:

* a plant, lemon-scented myrtle
* an animal, the platypus.

#### Scientific names often have Latin endings

The scientific names of plants and animals often derive from Latin. Check the
spelling when you use them.

It can help to recognise spelling patterns:

* The family names of plants usually end in ‘ceae’.
* The family names of animals usually end in ‘idae’.

<example> 
##### Example

 

Ornithorhynchus anatinus belongs to the Ornithorhynchidae family.

</example>

All classification names above genus level are in roman type and take initial
capitals.

<example> 
##### Example

 

* Backhousia citriodora is in the family Myrtaceae.
* Ornithorhynchus anatinus is in the order Monotremata.
</example>

#### Scientific names can include the name of a person

Technical content often includes the name of the person who first described the
species.

The person's name follows the first mention of the species in the content. The
publishing date of the description can also follow the name.  

The name and date, if they are included, appear in roman type.

<example> 
##### Example

 

Grevillea victoriae F.Muell. was first described by botanist Ferdinand von
Mueller.

</example>

There is a standard form for writing the person’s name. In this example,
‘F.Muell.’ is a standard abbreviation in biology – it uses full stops and has no
spaces. Check a biology dictionary if you are not certain.

Plants and animals are sometimes allocated to a different genus from the one
they were given when they were first described. In this case, the name and date
appear in parentheses after the genus and species name.

<example> 
##### Example

 

Robshelfordia circumducta (Walker, 1869)

[This shows that Walker first described the cockroach in 1869 as a species, but
another author has since allocated it to the genus Robshelfordia.]

</example>

#### Subcategories of species are usually abbreviated

For plants, there are 5 taxonomic categories below species level:

* subspecies (abbreviated as 'subsp.' for a single subspecies and 'subspp.' for more than one subspecies)
* variety (abbreviated as 'var.')
* subvariety (abbreviated as 'subvar.')
* form (abbreviated as 'f.')
* subform (abbreviated as 'subf.')

The abbreviations are in roman type and lower case. The subspecies and varietal
names themselves are in italics.

<example> 
##### Example

 

* Grevillea victoriae subsp. nivalis is one of the subspecies of this Grevillea genus.
* Grevillea banksii var. fosteri has beautiful blood-red flowers.
</example>

If the species or variety is unknown or unspecified, there is no word after the
abbreviation.

<example> 
##### Example

 

* Grevillea victoriae subsp.
* Grevillea banksii var.
</example>

For animals, there is only one taxonomic level below that of species:
subspecies. By convention, the abbreviation ‘subsp.’ is not used.

<example> 
##### Example

 

Macropus agilis jardinii is a subspecies of the agile wallaby (M. agilis).

</example>

### Use specialised resources for more information

Check the names of plants and animals. Make sure the information is up to date.

Use reliable sources such as:

* the [Australian National Herbarium’s Australian Plant Name Index](https://www.anbg.gov.au/apni/)
* the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/).

## Ships, aircraft and other vehicles

Names of ships, aircraft and other vehicles follow a set style. Using the
correct style helps people identify the names of vehicles in text.

### Italicise specific names and use capitals

Write the names of individual ships, aircraft and other vehicles:

* in italics
* with initial capitals.

This makes the name of the ship, aircraft or other vehicle clear. The name
contrasts with the rest of the sentence.

Don't use the definite article for navy ships.

<example> 
* HMAS Canberra is the Royal Australian Navy’s flagship.
* Australian–American astronaut Andy Thomas flew his first flight in space aboard the Endeavour.
* The Indian Pacific travels 4,532 kilometres from Perth to Sydney.
</example>

#### Accessibility requirements

Screen readers don’t pronounce italics. Use the semantic tag <em> to provide
emphasis for italicised names in HTML.

#### Names in citations

Separate the names of vehicles from titles in [citations and reference
lists](/node/181). Separate them according to the type of publication:

* If the title is in italics (such as in book and website titles), use roman type for the name of the vehicle.
* If the title is in roman type (such as a journal article), use italics for the name of the vehicle.

<example> 
* Mair C (2013) The lucky ship: the nine lives of the Australian coaster Tambar 1912–1960, Nautical Association of Australia, Australia.
* McMaugh D (21 March 2020) ‘Albatross breaks bread with women in need of a hand’, Navy Daily, accessed 24 March 2020.
</example>

### Don’t write brands or types of vehicles in italics

Begin the names of the brands, models and classes of vehicles with an initial
capital letter but don’t use italics.

<example> 
* She was driving a Toyota Corolla.
* A Boeing 737 brought the Australians home.
* They travelled in a Commodore for the last part of the journey.
</example>

Don’t italicise or capitalise types of ships, aircraft or other vehicles. Use an
initial capital for a generic name only if it starts a sentence.

<example> 
* During the Second World War, flying boats were deployed to strike remote enemy targets to Australia’s north.
* The Waco 10 was an open-cockpit biplane introduced in 1927.
* Mail trains stop at every town, adding hours to the trip.
</example>

Don’t italicise the definite article (the word ‘the’) before the vehicle’s
name unless it is part of the name.

<example> 
* The Ghan takes 54 hours to travel from Adelaide to Darwin. [The definite article is part of the train’s name.]
* The Dreamtime was on the shortlist for the name of Qantas’s new fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners. [The definite article is not part of the ship's name.]
</example>

Don’t put the abbreviated parts of a ship’s name in italics.

<example> 
* HMAS Arunta, HMAS Sydney
* The PS Albury travelled the Murray River in the mid-1800s.
</example>

Don’t use italics for the ship’s class name.

<example> 
HMAS Anzac (III) is the lead ship of eight Anzac Class frigates.

</example>

### Refer to vehicles with the pronoun ‘it’

Use the pronoun ‘it’ for ships, aircraft and other vehicles. Do not write
‘she’ when referring to vehicles in government content. Use pronouns that
reflect [gender-neutral language](/node/64##use_genderneutral_language).

<example> 
 

Brisbane was the first stop for the replica Endeavour on its maiden
circumnavigation of Australia.

</example>

## Topographic terms

Correct capitalisation helps people identify topographic and geographic terms in
your content. Refer to landmark features, regions and compass points correctly.

### Write official names with capitals

Check official place names and [style them correctly](/node/134). You can check
the spelling of an official name using the [Australian Place Names
dataset](https://placenames.fsdf.org.au/).

The full names of mountains, rivers, valleys, bays, islands and other features
always take initial capitals.

<example> 
* the Hunter Valley
* the Three Sisters
* the Paroo River
</example>

Some shortened forms that are popular names or nicknames are also capitalised.

<example> 
* The Snowy Mountains can also be called the ‘Snowies’.
* The northern part of the Northern Territory is known as the ‘Top End’.
</example>

### Write generic terms in lower case

In most cases, don’t use initial capitals when you use the name as a generic
term.

<example> 
I paddled a kayak 200 km down the Balonne River. The river was in flood for some
of the trip.

</example>

When using the same generic term for 2 or more names in the same sentence, use
lower case for the generic term.

<example> 
The Barossa and Hunter valleys are important winemaking areas. [The word
‘valley’ refers to both valleys. It’s used generically and does not take an
initial capital.]

The Barossa Valley is in South Australia and the Hunter Valley is in New South
Wales. [The word ‘valley’ is part of the name of each valley and so is
capitalised.]

</example>

Keep the initial capital when the general term is a well-recognised abbreviation
and works as a proper name.

<example> 
The Great Barrier Reef is also called ‘the Reef’.

The Gulf of Carpentaria is also known as ‘the Gulf’.

</example>

Don’t use an initial capital if you’re using the noun in a generic sense.

<example> 
The Amazon rainforest is vital to the health of our planet. [The ‘Amazon
rainforest’ is not the official name of the region. The word ‘rainforest’ is
generic and doesn’t need an initial capital.]

</example>

### Limit abbreviated names

‘Mt’ is a common and easily recognisable abbreviation for mountains. Use the
abbreviation consistently in content and use initial capitals.

<example> 
Mt Tennent is part of Namadgi National Park.

</example>

Spell out the names of other topographic features if you can. Use the
abbreviated form only where there’s limited space or a lot of repetition, such
as in tables and maps.

Use Geoscience Australia’s [authorised
abbreviations](http://www.ga.gov.au/mapspecs/topographic/v6/section2.html##AuthorisedAbbreviations).

<example> 
* C Tribulation [Cape]
* L Burley Griffin [Lake]
* Murray R [River]
* Green Is [Island]
* Keppel Bay Is [Islands]
</example>

### Don’t use an apostrophe for possessive names

Don’t use an apostrophe for topographic terms involving possessives. Official
place names are not possessive and do not usually include punctuation.

Refer to related [guidance on Australian place
names](/node/134##check_official_place_names_and_style_them_correctly).

<example> 
#### Correct

 

* Careys Peak
</example>

### Spell the plural form correctly

The plural of any topographic name is formed simply by adding ‘s’ or ‘es’.

<example> 
 

There are 4 Mount Wellingtons in Australia but only one Mount Coot-tha.

* There are 3 Mount Jameses in Australia. There is one in Queensland, one in South Australia and one in Western Australia.
</example>

### Write compass points in lower case

In text, write the points of a compass in lower case. Use hyphens for points
such as ‘north-east’.

<example> 
 

* south
* north-east
* west-north-west
* A north-westerly wind was blowing the fire towards the town.
* The car was 30 degrees east of where it should have been.
* A cool change was coming from the south.
</example>

You can use initialisms in tables, illustrations and some specialist works.
Always use capital letters with no full stops or hyphens.

<example> 
#### Example

      Initialisms often identify the points on a compass in illustrations  </example>

## Choosing numerals or words

Numbers as numerals are generally easier for people to scan. Numbers as words
remain a convention that people expect in some types of content.

### Use numerals for 2 and above in text

In text, the general rule is:

* Use numerals for ‘2’ and above.
* Write the numbers ‘zero’ and ‘one’ in words.

Follow the same rule for writing numbers in [headings and
subheadings](/node/51). Apply exceptions to this general rule in specific
situations, explained on this page.

The numbers ‘0’ and ‘1’ are difficult for some users to read. Some
typefaces make it difficult to see the difference between:

* the letter ‘O’ and numeral ‘0’
* the letters ‘I’ (capital ‘i’), ‘l’ (lower-case ‘L’) and numeral ‘1’.

In some typefaces, the numeral ‘1’ can also be confused with the numeral ‘7’.

Writing ‘zero’ and ‘one’ helps to ensure all users understand you are referring
to the number.

<example>
* Only one person agreed to it.
* Their aim is zero net emissions by 2050.
* They were open to discussing 3 options.</example>

### Use words for 2 and above in these specific situations

There are exceptions to the general rule for using numerals in text.

Use words for numbers when:

* starting a sentence
* writing a fraction
* writing a proper noun that includes a number written as a word
* writing a publication title that includes a number written as a word
* quoting a figure of speech.

In addition, use words for numbers below 10 for government content that follows
journalistic conventions (for example, media releases).

#### Starting a sentence with a number

Start sentences with words rather than numerals. If you must use a number at the
start of a sentence, write it out in words.

<example>
* Twelve people from our group went to the rally.
* From our group, 12 people went to the rally.</example>

It is sometimes better to rearrange the sentence.

<example>
* The board received 621 complaints.</example>

#### Fractions

Write words in general text for [fractions](/node/146).

Use fractions when:

* an exact number is not important
* the user needs only a general idea of the values.

If the exact number and value is important, use decimals instead.

<example>
* About two-thirds of staff attended last week’s meeting.
* There were 270 candidates for the Legislative Council, an average of 7.5 candidates per vacancy.</example>

#### Proper nouns, titles of publications and figures of speech

Write numbers as words if this is how they appear in a name or title.

<example>
The Treasurer wrote the terms of reference for the Review of the Four Major
Banks and Other Financial Institutions.

Private politics : a study of five political outlooks by Alan Davies</example>

Use words for figures of speech.

<example>
* Two’s company and three’s a crowd.
* Let’s take five.
* She felt ten feet tall.</example>

#### Government content and other style conventions

Various style guides treat numbers differently. Media organisations generally
use words for all numbers below 10 (or 11), and use numerals for the rest.

Content of the same type necessarily uses the same style, for example, in media
releases.

Check your [user research](/node/76). It might show a need to use words for
numbers other than ‘zero’ and ‘one’, for example, in:

* longer works
* print publications containing very few numbers.

Be consistent. Once your style for numerals or words is settled, use the same
style throughout the content or series of publications.

### Write all numbers as numerals in these specific situations

There are exceptions to using words for ‘zero’ and ‘one’.

Write all numbers as numerals:

* in units of measurement
* to show mathematical relationships – such as equations and ratios – and for decimals
* when you are comparing numbers
* in tables and charts
* for dates and times
* in a series of numbers
* in specific contexts – such as steps, instructions, age and school years
* in scientific content.

#### Units of measurement

Always use numerals to report a measurement (unless it is a large rounded
number).

<example>

##### Correct

* 1 km
* 1 kilometre</example>

#### Mathematical formats, relationships and comparisons

Always use numerals:

* to show mathematical relationships (such as equations and ratios)
* in decimal numbers
* to compare numbers
* in tables, graphs and charts.

Use numerals when writing fractions in specialist content. Otherwise the general
rule is words for [fractions](/node/146).

##### Mathematical relationships

Use well-understood conventions to write [mathematical
relationships](/node/145). Keep relationships together so they are easily
understood. To do this use:

* numerals only
* the correct operator characters
* spacing between numerals and operators
* non-breaking spaces.

<example>
* a ratio of 7∶1
* 8 + 1 = 9</example>

##### Decimal numbers

Use decimals when you need to be precise. Always write them as numerals.

<example>
* They had 8.5 full-time equivalent staff in the section.
* Innisfail averages 3,547.8 mm of rainfall per year.</example>

##### Comparisons

Compare numerals, not words and numerals. If one number is a decimal, the other
must be a decimal and so on.

<example>
For those aged 75 to 84, the rate was 2.5 times as high as the rate for the
control group. This fell to 1.1 times as high for those aged 85 and over.</example>

Comparisons are sometimes hard for people, so make them clear. It may seem
obvious, but comparisons are only useful if like is compared with like.

##### Tables, graphs and charts

Lists or blocks of data must consist of numerals, or people will find them hard
to understand. Always use numerals in graphs, charts and [tables](/node/45).
Numerals save space and help people scan, find and compare values quickly.

Restrict data to key indicators and results. Keep the presentation of data as
simple as possible, and use consistent units and magnitudes.

#### Date and times

Always use numerals for [dates and time](/node/140).

<example>
* Wednesday 1 April 2020
* She took the call at 1 pm.</example>

#### Series of numbers

In any document that contains a lot of numbers, it is always better to write
numbers as numerals.

Always use numerals for:

* a related group of items
* a discussion of statistics.

This is regardless of the size of the numbers involved.

<example>
The anthology includes 160 poems by 22 poets – 14 of whom were born in
Australia, 4 in New Zealand, 3 in England and 1 in Austria.

The number of internet subscribers increased by 3.6%. Fibre connections grew by
22.4% and fibre growth for the year to June was 69.8%.</example>

If you have two series of numbers, for the sake of clarity you can use words for
one series and numerals for the other.

<example>
Of the mothers of the 23 sets of triplets registered during the year, 8 had no
previous children, 8 had one child and 7 had two previous children.

[The first series uses numerals to break down the total number of triplets
according to groups of mothers. The second series uses words for the number of
children each group of mothers had already had.]</example>

#### Lists of steps and instructions

Lists, points and instructions are easier to follow if written as numerals.

<example>
* 1. Write a list
* In point 2 of the record of discussion ...
* Step 3: insert the audio cable into the left audio jack.</example>

#### Age and school years

Always use numerals for age and school years.

<example>
* They're a close-knit group of 12-year-olds.
* The siblings are in year 1 and year 5.</example>

#### In scientific content

You can use powers of 10 for large numbers in technical content, such as science
and engineering publications. Don’t use powers of 10 in general content.

<example>

##### Example

2.5 × 106 is the same as 2,500,000</example>

### Use commas in numbers with 4 or more digits

Numbers from 1,000 need a
[comma](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/commas).
Separate the digits into groups of 3 (working from right to left).

<example>

##### Example

* 1,750
* 25,690
* 745,902,350</example>

Don’t use a space or non-breaking space instead of a comma. This is because
screen readers can announce spaced digits as separate numbers.

<example>

##### Correct

* The government awards 2,500 grants to community projects annually.</example>

### Combine numerals and words for large, rounded numbers

Numbers below a million are easy to read as numerals. When you’re using rounded
numbers of 1,000 or more, [use commas to separate numerals into groups of
3](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/commas##use_commas_in_numbers_with_4_or_more_digits) (working
right to left).

Use a combination of numerals and words for large numbers from a million when
they are rounded. It is easier to read ‘2.5 million’ than ‘2,500,000’.

<example>

#### Example

* There are over 1.4 million students enrolled in Australian tertiary institutions.
* The budget allocated $50 billion to that initiative.
* The organisation announced $3 trillion in superannuation savings.</example>

Billions, trillions, quadrillions, quintillions:

* billion = 1,000 × million (109)
* trillion = 1,000 × billion (1012)
* quadrillion = 1,000 × trillion (1015).
* quintillion = 1,000 × quadrillion (1018).

### Use ‘1 million’ and ‘one million’ in certain contexts

Both forms are acceptable in government content. Choosing which style to use
will depend on the context and the type of content.

#### When to use ‘1 million’

Our rule to combine numerals with words for large, rounded numbers includes ‘1
million’. The same rule applies to ‘1 billion’, ‘1 trillion’ and so on.

Use the numeral ‘1’ in large, rounded numbers for the reasons listed as
exceptions in ‘[Write all numbers as numerals in these specific
situations](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words##write_all_numbers_as_numerals_in_these_specific_situations)’.

This includes writing ‘1 million’:

* in technical content
* in documents containing a lot of numbers
* in a series of numbers
* when comparing numbers
* with a currency symbol.

<example>

##### Example

* The agency manages close to 1 billion online transactions, 30.5 million calls and 6 million emails annually.
* Vaccine doses purchased by government this year:  • 10 million in May   • 20 million in June   • 1 million in October.
* Last year, the country exported goods worth over €1 trillion.</example>

##### In general content

You can also use ‘1 million’ in general content – the numeral and word together
make the meaning clear.

The words ‘million’, ‘billion’ and ‘trillion’ appear immediately after the
numeral ‘1’ in these large, rounded numbers. This proximity gives people the
context they need. It’s unlikely users will mistake the numeral ‘1’ for the
capital i (I) or the lower-case L (l) – whatever font you use.

However, it is hard to tell the difference between 1 and 7 in some sans serif
fonts. Change the typeface to ensure your numbers are readable.

If you can’t, it is better to use words or follow each number with their
equivalent word in parentheses:

* 1 (one) million
* 7 (seven) million.

And if you combine 1 and 7 in a number – for example, ‘1.7 million’ – follow the
number with its equivalent in words in parentheses. This is awkward but avoids
confusion.

<example>

###### Example

* An estimated 1 million of those eligible did not apply. [Large, rounded number in general content
* The report shows that telcos blocked over 1 (one) billion scams last year. [Number repeated in words to avoid confusion in some fonts]
* There are 1.7 million (one point seven million) Australians who are unaware they have the chronic disease. [Number repeated in words to avoid possible confusion between 1 and 7 in some fonts]</example>

Media releases follow journalistic style (one, two … nine, 10), but you can also
choose to use numerals for large, rounded numbers. This is a useful option for
media releases that contain several numbers.

<example>

###### Example

* After its recent expansion, which cost $5 million, the facility increased its production of sterile fruit flies to 40 million a week. In the 18 months since the facility opened, it has produced more than 1 billion flies for release. [Large, rounded numbers with numerals and words in media release]</example>

#### When to use ‘one million’

While our rule for large, rounded numbers captures ‘1 million’, our general rule
for numbers is to use words for the numeral ‘one’. And in some content, writing
‘one million’ is a good choice.

You can choose to use words for large, rounded numbers:

* to start a sentence
* in content with very few numbers
* in content that follows journalistic style – for example, in media releases
* if there’s any chance users will confuse numerals.

<example>
##### Example

* Every year, the facility recycles close to one billion plastic bottles. [General content with very few numbers]
* One million dollars will allow the firm to expand production. [Starting a sentence]
* Nearly one million Australians downloaded the app last month. [Sentence in media release]</example>

### Choose between numerals or words for currency

Use numerals and symbols for amounts of [money](currency).

<example>
#### Example

* They self-declared a $0 turnover.
* 50c
* $1
* US$20,000.</example>

However, money can be written entirely in words for approximations and figures
of speech.

<example>
#### Example

* The government’s new policy will save thousands of dollars.
* That’s my two cents worth.</example>

## Currency

Use the correct numbers, words and symbols for currency so people are clear
about the amount.

### Quantify an amount of money with a symbol and numeral

Write amounts using the relevant currency symbol followed by numerals. Don’t put
a space between the currency symbol and the numerals.

<example> 
* $27.99
</example>

For an amount less than $1, you can write it either as a whole number of cents
or as a [decimal
value](/node/146##use_0_before_a_decimal_point_for_values_less_than_one).

For the cents form:

* Use the letter ‘c’ for cents after the numerals.
* Don’t add a space between the numerals and the ‘c’.
* Don’t use a full stop after the ‘c’ unless it’s at the end of a sentence.

<example> 
* $0.50
* 50c
</example>
If the amount is a decimal number, always use 2 digits after the decimal point.

<example> 
* $0.80
* $0.78
</example>

If the amount is less than 10 cents, use a zero before the number of cents.

<example> 
#### Correct
* $0.04
</example>

### Clarify when you are using Australian dollars

Where content is clearly only referencing Australian dollars, use ‘$’.

<example> 
The minimum wage in Australia is $19.49 per hour.

</example>

If users could be confused about the currency being referenced, place ‘A’ before
the ‘$’. Don’t insert a space between them.

<example> 
The minimum wage in Australia is A$19.49 per hour. [Use of ‘A’ is appropriate if
the content is intended for users outside Australia.]

The journalist was paid A$89 per hour during her posting in Hong Kong. [Use of
‘A’ helps users understand that the journalist was not paid in Hong Kong
dollars].

</example>

### Reference non-Australian currencies for accessibility

Non-Australian currency symbols may be inaccessible to people who access content
using screen readers. Screen readers may be unable to interpret and describe the
symbols. Avoid the use of non-Australian currency symbols where possible.

#### Options for referencing non-Australian currencies

Use the 3-letter International Bank Account Number [(IBAN) currency
codes](https://www.iban.com/currency-codes) – for example, THB, USD, VND. This
is the preferred method because it doesn’t use symbols and makes content more
accessible.

When referencing ‘dollar’ currencies, use a country prefix followed by the ‘$’
symbol – for example, A$, C$, NZ$, US$. If there is any chance of confusion, use
the 3-letter IBAN codes.

Use the currency symbol only, for example ‘£’ for the British pound, if you have
evidence that it is the best way to meet a user need.

#### Using IBAN currency codes (preferred)

Use them for all currencies referenced in the content (including Australian
dollars).

Don’t place a space between the IBAN currency code and the numerals.

Use the same number of decimal places for all the currencies you refer to.

<example> 
Minimum wages are currently:

* Australia – AUD19.49 per hour
* Thailand – THB313.00 per day
* Vanuatu – VUV220.00 per hour
* Vietnam – VND4.18 million per month (urban Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City).
</example>

If using foreign currency symbols:

* Explain them on first use unless they are very widely known (for example, US$).
* Place them before the numerals and don’t insert a space.
* Don’t also use the IBAN currency code.

<example> 
 

The minimum wage in Japan is currently Japanese yen (¥) 901 per hour. It was
previously ¥874 per hour. [The Japanese yen symbol isn’t very widely known
in Australia, so explain it at first mention unless you're writing for a
specialist audience familiar with the symbol.]

The minimum wage in the United States is currently US$7.25 per hour. [Because
US$ is very widely known, don’t explain it on first use.]

</example>

#### Former Australian currency units

Use words rather than symbols for former Australian currency.

Before 14 February 1966, pounds (£), shillings (s) and pence (d) were
Australia’s units of currency. Few people would recognise these symbols now, so
write them out in full.

<example> 
 

9 pounds, 8 shillings and 7 pence

</example>

Some countries still use pounds as their currency. If there is any chance of
confusion, state ‘former Australian pounds’ or use the symbol ‘A£’.

### Quantify large amounts of money

Use the level of precision needed for the content.

<example> 
 

* They spent more than $2.1 million. [Use in descriptive text.]
* Total expenditure was $2.195 million. [Use in a financial report.]
* $2.195m [Use in a table or chart. No space or full stop. Explain the shortened form ‘m’ in a note.]
</example>

### Use words for inexact amounts

Use words for amounts of money that are an expression rather than an actual
amount.

<example> 
 

* This approach is likely to save thousands of dollars.
* The contract was worth several million dollars.
</example>

## Dates and time

Dates and expressions of time need to be readable and clear, particularly in
content that contains detailed timelines. Write, abbreviate and punctuate dates
and times consistently so people can understand your content. Follow
international and Australian standards to write dates and times for data systems
and international communication.

### Follow Australian conventions for dates

There are Australian conventions for writing dates in words and numerals, and in
numeric formats. These conventions include how to sequence elements of the date.

Use numerals and words for dates in most content. Use numeric dates when space
is limited and in content types like tables.

### Combine numerals and words for dates in body text

In Australia, the conventional sequence for dates is ‘day month year’. Use this
sequence when expressing dates in numerals and words.

For dates in body text, use numerals for the day and year and spell out the name
of the month. Don’t include a comma or any other punctuation.

Spell out the name of the day if it is being used, but don’t include a comma
after the day.

The names of months and days start with an initial capital because they are
[proper
nouns](//www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/nouns##proper_nouns_are_the_names_of_people_and_specific_things”).

<example>
* 31 December 2020
* Thursday 31 December 2020</example>

Insert a [non-breaking space](##NonBreakSpace) between the day and the month so
they stay together on one line. A non-breaking space means that a line break
will split the date before the year.

Keeping the day and month together allows people to identify the information
appearing before the line break as a date.

<example>
* Please find attached the new agenda for the extraordinary general meeting, 2 pm 8 November 2022. [With a non-breaking space between ‘8’ and ‘November’]</example>

Don’t use an [ordinal
number](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/ordinal-numbers)
(12th, 21st etc.) when writing dates in body text.

<example>
* 1 May 1997
* Schedule 3 commences on the first 1 July after the bill receives Royal Assent. [Extract from an explanatory memorandum]</example>

#### Incomplete dates

Follow the general rules above when writing incomplete dates. Spell out the
month in words if you need to leave out either the day or the year.

<example>
* The winning yacht usually reaches Hobart on 27 December.
* More than 1,700 jobs have been created since January 2018.</example>

There is an exception to the general rule for writing dates in body text. If you
refer to the day but not the month, use an [ordinal
number](//www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/ordinal-numbers).

Don’t put the ordinal suffix (‘st’, ‘nd’, ‘rd’ or ‘th’) in superscript.
Superscript can cause problems for people who use screen readers.

<example>
* She will leave by the 20th.</example>

If you refer to the year only, use the full numerical year. Don’t abbreviate it.

<example>
* 1945</example>

### Use shortened forms for dates when space is limited

Only use abbreviations if space is limited – for example, in tables,
illustrations, charts and notes. Ensure that it is obvious to users which days
of the week or months you are referring to.

The standard abbreviations for the days of the week are:

* Monday – ‘Mon’ or ‘M’
* Tuesday – ‘Tues’ (‘Tue’) or ‘Tu’
* Wednesday – ‘Wed’ or ‘W’
* Thursday – 'Thurs’ (‘Thur’,‘Thu’) or ‘Th’
* Friday – ‘Fri’ or ‘F’
* Saturday – ‘Sat’ or ‘Sa’
* Sunday – ‘Sun’ or ‘Su’.

The abbreviations in parentheses are alternatives for the standard abbreviation
they follow. Only use the alternatives when the context ensures their meaning is
clear.

Note: Style Manual lists Monday as the first day of the week. This is consistent
with the order of calendar days in a calendar week as defined in the
[international standard adopted by Australia](##IntlCom).

The standard abbreviations for the months are:

* January – ‘Jan’
* February – ‘Feb’
* March – ‘Mar’
* April – ‘Apr’
* May – retain as ‘May’
* June – retain as ‘June’ or shorten to ‘Jun’
* July – retain as ‘July’ or shorten to ‘Jul’
* August – ‘Aug’
* September – ‘Sept’ or shorten to ‘Sep’
* October – ‘Oct’
* November – ‘Nov’
* December – ‘Dec’.

Only use the shortest form of days and months – ‘F’, ‘M’, ‘N’ and so on – in
limited applications. An example is a time-series chart where the context and
order allow users to understand the difference between each capital letter.

Don’t use a full stop after shortened days and months. No full stop is the
correct Australian Government style for all
[abbreviations](//www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/abbreviations),
[acronyms and
initialisms](//www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/acronyms-and-initialisms)
and
[contractions](//www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/contractions).

#### Don’t abbreviate dates in body text

Avoid abbreviated words when writing dates in body text. Words written in full
are usually easier to read and understand.

<example>
The Labor Party called an urgent conference on Saturday 22 December.</example>

### Don’t write dates as numerals unless space is limited

Avoid writing dates entirely in numerals for general content. Use numeric dates
only when space is limited (such as in tables).

Numeric dates can be confusing because their order and format differs between
countries.

Use Australia’s conventional order of ‘day month year’ unless you are writing
for users in a country that uses a different style.

#### Use a forward slash in numeric dates

Separate the numbers in a numeric date with an unspaced forward slash, using the
format ‘day/month/year’. This format uses single digits for single-digit days
and months.

<example>
* 4/6/2021 [Australia: d/m/yyyy]
* 7/12/2020</example>

#### Numeric dates can have 2-digit elements

You can also use 2 digits for each element.

Only use this style for the year:

* in financial data
* if it is clear which century you are referring to
* if users understand the order of the elements (‘day month year’ for Australian users).

<example>
* 07/12/20
* 30/06/22</example>

Whichever style you use for date formats, use it consistently.

#### Full stops in computer applications

Many computer systems and applications use a full stop in numeric dates. Use 2
digits for the day and month and 4 digits for the year: ‘dd.mm.yyyy’.

<example>
* 07.12.2020
* 10.09.2021</example>

### Don’t use an apostrophe for decades

Write decades with an ‘s’ on the end. Don’t use an [apostrophe](/node/106) to
show the plural.

<example>

##### Correct

* 2010s
* 1980s</example>

In more casual writing, you can use expressions such as ‘the eighties’. You can
also use an apostrophe to show the missing numerals in a decade – for example,
‘In the ’80s, all my jackets had shoulder pads.’

### Use words for spans of years in body text

As a general rule, write spans of years in words, using ‘to’, ‘from … to’ or
‘between … and’. Write the years out in full, not as abbreviations.

Don’t replace the word between the years with an [en
dash](//www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/dashes).

<example>
* the years 2015 to 2019
* from 2015 to 2019
* between 2015 and 2019</example>

### Use en dashes for particular types of year spans

Government content often includes spans of years. Some year spans are easier to
read and understand if they contain an unspaced en dash rather than words.

This is particularly true in content that contains multiple spans of years. In
this case, using en dashes makes the content easier to scan.

Use an unspaced en dash for a:

* financial year
* calendar year
* span of years in the titles of publications and programs
* span of years written in parentheses, such as for a term of office and the years of birth and death.

Always include the phrases ‘financial year’, ‘financial years’, ‘calendar year’
or ‘calendar years’ unless the context makes the meaning clear. You can also
introduce the relevant phrase at first mention and just write the year span,
without the phrase, in later mentions.

Finally, exercise your judgement. Consider using en dashes for year spans when
using words makes the content harder to read.

<example>
* This document includes expenditure and revenue estimates for the 2021–22 financial year. For comparison, the attachment contains estimates for 2020–21 and 2019–20.
* The agency measures injury hospitalisations and deaths over 2 calendar years. Data showed a small increase in injury hospitalisations for 2017–2018 and 2019–2020. Injury deaths declined over the earlier period, but showed a marked increase for 2019–2020.
* The library holds a reference copy of the Inclusion and diversity strategy 2022–24.
* Alfred Deakin was Prime Minister for much of Australia’s 2nd Parliament (1903–1906).
* Sidney Nolan (1917–1992) had 3 younger siblings.</example>

Always use unspaced en dashes in spans of years. Don’t use forward slashes.

<example>
* National Road Safety Action Plan 2018–20
* Australia’s energy consumption rose by 0.6% in 2018–19 and fell by 2.9% in 2019–20.</example>

### Use words for spans of days and months in body text

As a general rule, use ‘from … to’ and ‘between … and’ in spans of days and
months.

If it’s appropriate for your content, keep elements of the span together by
inserting [non-breaking spaces](##NonBreakSpace) between them.

When you include a year, insert a non-breaking space between the day and month.
A non-breaking space keeps the day and month together while the line break
splits the date before the year.

<example>
* Parliament is scheduled to sit from 3 to 21 December. [Non-breaking spaces between ‘3’, ‘to’, ‘21’ and ‘December’]
* We will do snap inspections between 6 and 8 September. [Non-breaking spaces between ‘6’, ‘and’, ‘8’ and ‘September’]
* The exhibition will run from 30 November to 23 February 2022. [Non-breaking space between ‘30’ and ‘November’ and between ‘23’ and ‘February’]</example>

### Use en dashes for spans of days and months when space is limited

Only use en dashes for spans of days and months if you have limited space. This
could be in display text, tables, lists or in social media posts.

But also exercise your judgement – consider using en dashes if using words makes
the content harder to read.

The en dash is spaced when the day and month appear on both sides of the span.

<example>
     </example>

The en dash is unspaced when the month only appears at the end of the span.

<example>
* ##### Symposium Series 2025
  Plain language: 3–5 MarchAccessible tables: 9–11 JuneContent design: 8–10
  September</example>

### Refer to specific days, events and periods with capitals

Treat specific days, public events and periods in history as proper nouns and
use initial capitals. Use lower case for ‘the’ and any
[prepositions](/node/130), unless they are capitalised as part of a proprietary
name.

In body text, use lower case for generic terms like the names of seasons
–‘autumn’ – and astronomical events such as ‘equinox’ and ‘solstice’. Write
‘century’ and ‘centuries’ in lower case.

#### Holidays and events

Use initial capitals for all institutional holidays, religious days and public
events. Follow the capitalisation of proprietary names.

<example>
* New Year’s Day
* Good Friday
* Ramadan
* Yom Kippur
* the City2Surf
* the AFL Grand Final
* Labour Day
* the Adelaide Festival
* Party In The Paddock 2024
* Anzac Day [‘Anzac’ stands for Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, but only takes an initial capital. The acronym appears in legislation with an initial capital and this has become the commonly-used form.]</example>

#### Periods and events of historical importance

Use initial capitals for specific periods and events of historical importance,
but not when you abbreviate them to a generic term.

<example>
* the Renaissance
* the Bronze Age
* the French Revolution, the revolution
* the Battle of Long Tan, the battle</example>

#### World wars

There are 2 acceptable styles for referring to the world wars.

Use either style, but be consistent in your content.

<example>
* First World War, Second World War
* World War I, World War II [With roman numerals]</example>

Use 2 [non-breaking spaces](##NonBreakSpace) to keep each name together on one
line of text.

Write ‘World War I’ and ‘World War II’ with roman numerals.

The accepted way to write most roman numerals is by typing letters of the
alphabet. Use a capital ‘i’ – I – for the world wars.

The Style Manual acknowledges that the house styles of some government agencies
require the use of the arabic numerals ‘1’ and ‘2’. User research will always
guide an agency’s style choices. Our recommendation to use roman numerals comes
from corpus evidence.

##### Shortened forms for world wars

In content with many mentions of the world wars, you might decide to use a
shortened form. Write the name of the war out in full the first time you use it.
Include the shortened form in parentheses immediately afterwards and use the
shortened form from then on.

Use roman numerals in the shortened form.

<example>

###### Example

* The Second World War (WWII) started in 1939. Many Australians died in WWII.
* World War I (WWI) started in 1914. Many Australians enlisted for service in WWI.</example>

#### Eras and periods

Use initial capitals for the actual name of a geological era or period but not
for broad historical and cultural times.

<example>

##### Example

* the Lower Jurassic period
* the Mesozoic era
* the colonial era
* baroque ornamentation</example>

#### Centuries

Use numerals, not words, for centuries. This is an exception to the rule for
[ordinal
numbers](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/ordinal-numbers##use_words_for_ordinals_up_to_ninth_and_numerals_for_10th_and_above).

Write ‘century’ and ‘centuries’ in lower case.

Don’t use shortened forms, such as 18C or C18, unless you have limited space.

Don’t use superscript for the ordinal suffix.

<example>
* the 18th century
* in the 2nd and 3rd centuries
* a 19th-century writer
* an 8th-century monastery</example>

Use CE and BCE to represent the common era (CE) and the time before the common
era (BCE). There is no ‘year 0’ in this system. The years progress from 1 BCE to
1 CE.

Write ‘CE’ and ‘BCE’ without full stops and with a [non-breaking
space](##NonBreakSpace) separating them from the year or century.

<example>

##### Example

* 44 BCE
* 1452 CE
* the 3rd century BCE
* the 3rd century CE</example>

#### Seasons and seasonal events

Use lower case for the seasons and recurrent seasonal events.

<example>

##### Example

* winter
* summer solstice</example>

### Use numerals for times of day

In most documents, numerals give a clearer expression of time. Write times of
day using numerals, especially when you need to convey precise times.

Use a colon between the hours and minutes. The use of a colon as the separator,
rather than a full stop, reflects a shift in contemporary Australian usage.

A colon ensures that the time isn’t confused with a decimal number.

For example, ‘10.50’ can be read as ‘10 and a half’ as well as ‘50 minutes past
10’. Screen reader users will probably hear ‘10.50’ as ‘10 point 5’.

<example>

#### Example

* The bus leaves at 8:22 am.
* The broadcast will run from 9:45 am to 11:45 am.</example>

#### Times using ‘am’ and ‘pm’

The initialisms ‘am’ and ‘pm’ come from the Latin phrases ante meridiem (before
noon) and post meridiem (after noon).

Write ‘am’ and ‘pm’ in lower case. Separate the numbers and the initialism with
a [non-breaking space](##NonBreakSpace).

Don’t use ‘am’ and ‘pm’ with words that duplicate their meaning, for example
‘morning’ and ‘afternoon’.

<example>

##### Correct

* Please respond by 10 am tomorrow.
* Let’s meet at 6:30 pm.</example>

You can use 2 zeros to show the full hour, but they aren’t essential. Use 2
zeros if that is consistent with other expressions of time in your content, such
as in running sheets.

<example>

##### Example

* 9 pm
* 9:00 pm</example>

#### Noon, midday and midnight

Use ‘noon’, ‘midday’ or ‘midnight’ instead of ‘12 am’ or ‘12 pm’. This makes it
easier for people to understand the time.

<example>
##### Write this

* We have extended the closing date to midnight Friday 7 October 2022.</example>

Write ‘o’clock’ only when you quote someone directly or transcribe a recording.
In these situations, use numerals and the word ‘o’clock’.

<example>
##### Example

* ‘The minister is speaking at about 10 o’clock,’ they said.</example>

#### The 24-hour clock

Use the 24-hour clock if it helps people understand your content. This is
important when referring to times in these contexts:

* travel
* certain scientific fields
* the armed services
* content written for countries using the 24-hour clock.

The 24-hour clock is also useful in content where space is limited. This is
because it uses fewer characters than times with ‘am’ and ‘pm’. For this reason,
it is often used in timetables and schedules.

This system numbers the hours from 00:00 hours (midnight) to 23:59. It always
uses at least 4 digits. It can have 6 digits if seconds are included:

* The first 2 digits are the hours.
* The next 2 digits are the minutes.
* The last 2 digits are the seconds, if you include them.

Always use a ‘leading zero’ for hours under 10 – for example, write ‘05:30’ not
‘5:30’.

Use a colon to separate the hours, minutes and seconds in the 24-hour clock.

<example>
##### Example

* 00:45 [12:45 am]
* 07:38 [7:38 am]
* 23:18 [11:18 pm]
* 23:59:17 [11:59:17 pm – includes hours, minutes and seconds]</example>

Don’t add ‘am’ or ‘pm’ to times written in 24-hour clock format.

<example>
##### Write this

* 06:45
* 23:18</example>

Some government agencies that produce technical and scientific content don’t use
a colon for the 24-hour clock – for example, 2300 and 0430. This is the ‘[basic
format](##Format)’ used for [international communication](##IntlComm).

If space is limited and you use the 24-hour clock in general content, we
recommend inserting a colon for clarity. This is the ‘[extended
format](##Format)’ used for [international communication](##IntlComm).

#### Time zones

You might need to define which time zone you are referring to.

Time zones are usually written with the 24-hour clock.

The main Australian zones are:

* ACST (Australian Central Standard Time)
* ACDT (Australian Central Daylight saving Time)
* AEST (Australian Eastern Standard Time)
* AEDT (Australian Eastern Daylight saving Time)
* AWST (Australian Western Standard Time)
* LHST (Lord Howe Standard Time)
* LHDT (Lord Howe Daylight Time).

Daylight saving time is not observed in the Northern Territory, Queensland and
Western Australia.

There are also time zones for some Australian external territories.

<example>
##### Example

The meeting will commence at 15:30 AEDT on 17 November 2022.</example>

#### Coordinated Universal Time

Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is a time standard used as the basis for
regulating world timekeeping.

UTC expresses the unadjusted local time at 0° longitude. It is not adjusted for
daylight saving. Local standard time at longitudes around the world is
represented by an offset to UTC.

UTC is based on International Atomic Time (TAI), which is a weighted average of
atomic clocks located around the world, including in Australia. TAI does not
take into account changes in the earth’s rotation, so leap seconds are
occasionally added to UTC.

UTC is the standard and legal reference for times of day in Australia. The
UTC(AUS) standard is maintained by the Australian Government’s [National
Measurement
Institute](https://www.industry.gov.au/national-measurement-institute).

Time zones are written as positive or negative offsets to UTC.

Write the initialism ‘UTC’, followed by ‘+’ or ‘−’, followed by the time offset
to UTC in 24-hour system format.

<example>
##### Example

* During winter, the time in Sydney is UTC+10:00.
* São Paulo is in the Brasília Time Zone which is UTC−03:00.</example>

### Use en dashes for spans of time when space is limited

Only use en dashes for time spans if you have limited space. This could be in
display text, tables, lists or in social media posts.

But also exercise your judgement – consider using en dashes if using words makes
the content harder to read.

The spacing of the en dash depends on the elements of the span.

Use an unspaced en dash:

* if the ‘am’ or ‘pm’ appears only at the end of the span
* for spans of time in the 24-hour clock format.

Use a spaced en dash:

* when ‘am’ or ‘pm’ appears on both sides of the span
* if ‘noon’, ‘midday’ or ‘midnight’ appears in the span.

<example>
#### Example

* Soccer training this Sat: 8–9 am
* Available appointment times are:08:00–08:1513:30–13:4516:45–17:00
* **Help desk opening hours**:Monday to Thursday: 7 am – 4 pmFriday: 9 am – midday</example>

Don’t combine words and the en dash.

<example>
#### Write this

* Closed 11 am – 2 pm.</example>

### Follow the manual’s number rules for duration

When expressing duration (lengths of time) in body text, follow Style Manual
rules about [choosing words or
numerals](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words).

This means writing the words ‘zero’ and ‘one’ and using numerals for ‘2’ and
above. The rules also say to use the numerals ‘0’ and ‘1’ in [specific
situations](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words##write_all_numbers_as_numerals_in_these_specific_situations).

For duration, the specific situations are likely to be when:

* you compare numbers in a sentence
* a sentence contains a series of numbers.

Write the words ‘zero’ and ‘one’ in sentences that don’t contain other numerals.
Write the numerals ‘0’ and ‘1’ in sentences that contain numerals from 2 and
above, or where all numbers show duration.

Spell out the units of time: ‘hours’, ‘minutes’ and ‘seconds’.

<example>
#### Example

* There are 7 minutes and 30 seconds remaining. [Numerals for 2 and above]
* The hearing adjourned for 2 hours. [Numerals for 2 and above]
* The committee will break for lunch for one hour. [Words for zero and one]
* Although we allowed candidates 1 minute to answer each question, most took over 2 minutes. [Numerals when comparing duration]
* I noted faults at these time stamps: 0 minutes 45 seconds, 1 minute 4 seconds and 3 minutes 8 seconds. [Numerals for a series of numbers showing duration]</example>

Use fractions written in words if users only need a general idea of values.

Only use decimal numbers if they are the best way to explain what people need to
know. But be aware that some people might not understand the decimal’s time
value. For example, 1.25 hours is 1 hour 15 minutes, not 1 hour 25 minutes.

It is usually better to avoid decimals and include the number and unit of time.

<example>
#### Example

* The session finished about a quarter of an hour early. [Words for a fraction – gives a general idea of the duration]
* I clocked her at 15 minutes and 12 seconds. [Easier to understand than 15.2
  minutes]
  They broke the record by 0.04 seconds. [Numeral – a decimal gives people the
  information that is appropriate in this context. But the words ‘… by 4
  hundredths of a second’ might be clearer to some users.]</example>

### Use shortened forms for units of time when space is limited

It is usually better to spell out the units that measure time. This is
particularly so in general content. Only use short forms if space is limited and
the short forms are easy to identify correctly.

If you need to abbreviate time, use the following units as shortened forms:

* second – s
* minute – min
* hour – h
* day – d
* week – wk
* month – mo
* year – y or yr (Choose one and use it consistently in your document.)

The International System of Units – SI – is the international standard for
measurement. The unit for second – symbol ‘s’ – is the [SI base unit for
time](https://www.bipm.org/en/si-base-units/second).

Other time measures are not SI units – but ‘min’, ‘h’ and ‘d’ are used with ‘s’
and recognised as legal units of measurement in Australia. They are listed in
Schedules 1 and 2 of the [National Measurement
Regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2019C00572).

There are also commonly-used shortened forms for time measures – for example,
‘wk’ (week), ‘mo’ (month) and ‘yr’ or ‘y’ (year). These are not legal units of
time, but are likely to be understood when used alongside other time units.

If your expression contains one time measure only, insert a [non-breaking
space](##NonBreakSpace) between the number and unit.

Never add an ‘s’ to show a plural.

<example>
#### Write this

* 35 s
* 15 min
* 6 h
* 5 d
* 3 wk
* 8 mo
* 2 y or 2 yr
* [There are non-breaking spaces between numbers and units. There is no ‘s’ to show plurals.]</example>

But don’t space a number and its unit when your expression contains more than
one time measure. Use a [non-breaking space](##NonBreakSpace) between each time
value instead.

Never add an ‘s’ to show a plural.

<example>
#### Write this

* 11min 12s
* 7h 8min 30s
* [There is no space between a number and its unit. There is a non-breaking space between each time measure in the expression.]</example>

Data systems support specific (and usually several) shortened forms for units of
time. For example, hours might be: h, hh, hr, hours, hrs. They might also be
case-sensitive or case-insensitive. You will need to check system
specifications.

### Avoid using ‘bi’ to mean either 2 or twice

The prefix ‘bi’ can be confusing when used with expressions of time:

* ‘Bimonthly’ can mean either every 2 months or twice a month.
* ‘Biannual’ means twice a year.
* ‘Biennial’ means every 2 years.

Instead of using these words, be clear about the frequency and period of time
you mean.

<example>
#### Write this

We meet once every 2 years.</example>

### How to combine dates and times

There is no fixed rule about the order of dates and times when combining them in
body text. You can choose whether the date or the time should come first. The
order doesn’t matter as long as the information is clear and the sentence flows
logically.

But make sure that:

* you follow the style rules for each element
* the time doesn’t come between the day and the date
* you use the same style consistently throughout your document.

<example>
#### Write this

* They will appear before the committee at 3 pm on Wednesday 7 August 2024.
* They will appear before the committee on Wednesday 7 August 2024 at 3 pm.
* [There is a non-breaking space between ‘3’ and ‘pm’, no comma after ‘Wednesday’, and a non-breaking space between ‘7’ and ‘August’.]</example>

#### Combining dates and times when space is limited

Use the same approach to combine the date and time when you have limited space.
This might be in a table, [social media
post](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/social-media), or in a
display or presentation context (display text).

We always recommend using minimal punctuation, but exercise your judgement. A
comma between the date and time can make information easier to scan if you
haven't used a preposition like ‘at’ or ‘on’.

You can also use [shortened forms for the date](##Short). Only do this if you are
sure users will understand what you mean.

<example>
##### Example

* Lunch and Learn: Financial security in the 1980sFriday 1 March at 12 midday3rd floor seminar room
* Lunch and Learn: Financial security in the 1980s12 midday, Friday 1 March3rd floor seminar room
* Content MeetupTue 23 Apr at 4 pmAll welcome!</example>

### Meet standards for data systems and information interchange

Follow international standards when writing dates and time:

* for international communication
* to transfer data between systems.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develops and publishes
the international standard for dates and time format – the [ISO
8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) series.

Australia and New Zealand have adopted the international standard. The Australia
– New Zealand standard is Date and time: representations for information
interchange. It is published as the AS/NZS ISO 8601 series in 2 parts:

* Part 1: basic rules
* Part 2: extensions

You can purchase copies of ISO 8601 and AS/NZS ISO 8601 from [Standards
Australia](https://store.standards.org.au/).

#### Standards are voluntary

International and Australian – New Zealand standards on dates and time are
voluntary.

The standards ensure that data systems and humans can exchange date and time
information internationally and across time zones in a recognised format.

A description of all the dates and times standards is beyond the scope of the
Style Manual.

We cover these standards from Part 1: basic rules:

* calendar date
* ordinal date
* local time of day
* combined calendar date and local time of day.

We don’t cover Part 2: extensions.

#### Basic and extended formats

There are 2 format options for each standard: ‘basic format’ and ‘extended
format’.

Basic format does not have separators between units of dates and time. Avoid
using basic format in body text. It is easy for computers to read but harder for
humans.

Extended format is also for computers, but it includes separators between units
to make it easier for humans to read.

We show both formats in our examples.

#### Calendar date

The standard sets out a descending order of year (4 digits), month (2 digits)
and day (2 digits) for a complete representation of calendar date.

The numbers can be unspaced (basic format) or separated by a hyphen (extended
format).

<example>
##### Example

20201207 [Calendar date, basic format]

2020-12-07 [Calendar date, extended format]</example>

ISO format is becoming more common, especially in software.

#### Ordinal date

Ordinal dates are often used when transferring data between data systems. This
is because they are easy for simple systems to read.

Ordinal dates are not the same as [ordinal
numbers](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/ordinal-numbers).

Ordinal dates have 7 digits:

* The first 4 digits represent the year.
* The next 3 digits represent the day.

This is the ISO standard. Some older systems might use 2 digits for the year,
not 4.

Days are numbered from 1 to 365 (366 for a leap year). For example, 20 September
is the 263rd day of the year (264th in a leap year) and its 3 digits are 263.

The ordinal date can be unspaced (basic format) or separated by a hyphen
(extended format).

If you use dates in electronic data transfer, use basic format and don’t
separate the numbers.

If people, rather than a computer, will read the information, use extended
format and insert a hyphen between the year and day.

<example>
##### Example

Write 7 January 2023 as:

* 2023007 [The 4-digit form for the year, basic format]
* 23007 [The 2-digit form for the year, basic format].

Write 31 July 2020 as:

* 2020-213 [The 4-digit form for the (leap) year, extended format]
* 20-213 [The 2-digit form for the (leap) year, extended format].</example>

#### Local time of day

The standard for a complete representation of local time of day starts with the
letter ‘T’ followed by 2-digit numbers for the hour, minute and second.

The numbers can be unspaced (basic format) or separated by a colon (extended
format).

You can omit the ‘T’ if there’s no possibility of confusion.

A ‘reduced precision’ time of 15 minutes after 7 pm in basic format – ‘1915’ –
can easily be confused with the calendar year 1915. In these cases, it is better
to write time of day as T1915 (basic format) or 19:15 (extended format).

Note: The format for local time of day doesn’t allow for daylight saving. The
format showing daylight saving includes the time shift between local time and
Coordinated Universal Time. This is beyond the scope of the Style Manual.

<example>
##### Example

* 153020 [Local time of day, basic format – 15h 30m 20s, that is 20 seconds after 3:30 pm]
* 15:30:20 [Local time of day, extended format]</example>

#### Combined date and local time of day

Combine date and local time of day using the style standards set out
[above](##IntlCom).

Always use the letter ‘T’ between the date and time.

The basic format for international communication is unspaced. The extended
format uses hyphens for the date and colons for the time of day.

<example>
##### Example

* 20230811T121505 [Basic format – 11 August 2023 at 15 minutes and 5 seconds after midday.]
* 2023-08-11T12:15:05 [Extended format]
* 2023223T121505 [Ordinal date, basic format – same date and time as above]
* 2023-223T12:15:05 [Ordinal date, extended format]</example>

### Insert a non-breaking space correctly

You can insert a non-breaking space using the Unicode character U+00A0.

In HTML, use the entity &nbsp; to insert a non-breaking space.

The keyboard shortcut in Word is Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar.

## Fractions and decimals

Decimals are useful when people need a precise value. Fractions are useful when
an exact value is not important.

### Choose between a decimal value or fraction

You can express a less-than-whole number as a decimal or as a fraction.

In text, write [decimal values as
numerals](/node/198##write_all_numbers_as_numerals_in_these_specific_situations).
Write [fractions as
words](/node/198##use_words_for_2_and_above_in_these_specific_situations).

<example> 
* 0.5 [Decimal value]
* half [Fraction]
</example>

Use decimals when you need to be precise.

<example> 
* They had 7.5 full-time equivalent staff in the section.
* Australia received 412.8 mm of rainfall this year.
</example>

Use fractions when:

* an exact number is not important
* the user needs only a general idea of the values.

<example> 
* About two-thirds of staff attended last week's meeting.
* The dam was three-quarters full.
</example>

### Use ‘0’ before a decimal point for values less than one

Decimal values less than one have a ‘0’ before the decimal point.

<example> 
#### Correct
0.59

</example>

Always use a full stop, not a comma, for the decimal point. This is the style
for Australian content.

<example> 
#### Correct
2.5687

</example>

## Mathematical relationships

A mathematical relationship is the connection between sets of numbers or
variables. In most content, the connection should be described in words. Only
use symbols if there’s a user need. Code symbols correctly to ensure they are
accessible.

### Use words instead of symbols to improve accessibility

In most content, explain mathematical relationships using words instead of
symbols.

Many people will understand simple operations written with symbols (1 + 1 = 2).
But other mathematical relationships are hard to understand unless they are
written in words. Symbols might not be available in every font set and the
default settings of screen readers might not read all symbols.

Remember that some users are unfamiliar with mathematical terminology. Make sure
that you explain terms and concepts in plain language.

This rule applies to general content. If you’re writing specialist mathematical
and scientific content, follow your publisher’s style.

In all mathematical expressions, [write numbers as
numerals](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words##write_all_numbers_as_numerals_in_these_specific_situations).
This applies even when you use words to explain a relationship between the
numbers.

<example> 
* The square root of 56 is greater than the square root of 26.
* We can prove that 0 does not equal 1.
</example>

### Use symbols when user research supports their use

Only use mathematical symbols in general content if user research shows they are
appropriate for your users and for the type of content.

Complicated mathematical relationships are difficult to express in words and are
best written using symbols. These are more likely to appear in technical
content, but user research might show it is appropriate to reproduce them in
general content.

If so, use the following guidance to write and space mathematical symbols
correctly.

#### Use code for symbols, not punctuation

Always use the correct code for mathematical symbols, including:

* plus +
* minus −
* multiplication ×
* division ÷
* greater than >
* less than <
* greater than or equal to ≥
* less than or equal to ≤.

The +, −, ×, and ÷ symbols are called ‘operators’ because they carry out an
operation on 2 elements of a mathematical expression. The >, <, ≥ and ≤ symbols
are ‘relations’ because they show a relationship between 2 elements of a
mathematical expression.

Don’t use punctuation marks (such as a dash) instead of a symbol.

Not all the symbols on your keyboard are coded correctly. It is better to insert
a symbol using its Unicode character or Word’s Insert>Symbol command.

You will find other codes, such as HTML entities, in the table, ‘[Codes for
mathematical symbols](##codes)’.

<example> 
##### Correct
* 8 − 0.5 [Using the Unicode character for minus; type ‘2212’ then ‘Alt+x’]
</example>

#### Note on terminology

The Style Manual uses ‘symbol’ rather than ‘sign’ when referring to particular
mathematical symbols. For example, when writing about the symbol ‘+’, we use
‘plus symbol’ or ‘plus’ rather than ‘plus sign’.

In mathematics, the ‘sign’ of a number generally means whether it is positive or
negative.

In non-technical writing however, it is acceptable to use the terms ‘plus sign’,
‘minus sign’, ‘multiplication sign’ and so on. ‘Sign’ is commonly used in
general content to mean a mathematical symbol.

#### Don’t use a symbol or a space for ratios

Ratios don’t use a symbol, unlike mathematical operators. Ratios use a
punctuation mark instead: the [colon](/node/104).

Ratios don’t have a space around the colon.

<example> 
##### Correct
5∶1 [Ratio with no spaces around the colon]

</example>

#### Accessibility requirements

Mathematical expressions in technical content often contain symbols and
superscript. Superscript is a number, letter or symbol placed above a character,
for example, the ‘2’ in ‘x2’.

Unless they are coded correctly, symbols and superscript may be inaccessible for
some people who:

* have low vision
* use screen readers to access content.

Insert symbols and superscript with tools such as:

* [Unicode](https://home.unicode.org/)
* [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
* [Mathematical Markup Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/) (MathML).

These tools make mathematical equations and symbols accessible, including for
screen readers.

Ensure both symbols and superscript can be enlarged without loss of content or
functionality. Don’t use images of symbols or superscript.

**Note on coding:** the Style Manual does not use MathML or LaTeX for this page.
Agencies working with a lot of mathematical and scientific content will likely
use these tools. Our aim is to help government writers of general content create
accessible mathematical content using the codes in the table: [Codes for
Mathematical
Symbols](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/mathematical-relationships##codes).

WCAG quick reference: [1.3.1 Info and relationships – level
A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##info-and-relationships)

#### Addition and positive numbers

Use the plus symbol (+) on your keyboard; it is coded correctly. You can also
use Word’s Insert>Symbol command or Unicode. The Unicode character is U+002B.

To show addition, use [non-breaking spaces](##nonbreak) around the plus symbol.

To show a positive value, write the number after the plus symbol without a
space. Here, the plus symbol is not working as an operator, it is [modifying the
number](##modify).

<example> 
##### Correct
2 + 10 [Addition with non-breaking spaces around the plus]

+3 [Positive value with no space after the plus]

</example>

#### Subtraction and negative numbers

Use the mathematical symbol for minus (−).

Don't use:

* the minus symbol on the numerical keypad
* an en dash (–)
* a hyphen (-).

In Unicode, the symbol for minus is U+2212.

To show subtraction, use [non-breaking spaces](##nonbreak) around the minus
symbol.

To show a negative value, write the number after the minus symbol without a
space.

Here, the minus sign is not working as an operator, it is [modifying the
number](##modify).

<example> 
##### Correct
12 − 4 [Subtraction with non-breaking spaces around the minus]

−5 [Negative value with no space after the minus]

</example>

#### Division

Use the division symbol (÷) or the division slash ( ∕ ). People sometimes use
the forward slash (/) to show division as well.

Use [non-breaking spaces](##nonbreak) around the division symbol.

Programming languages and Excel use the forward slash (/) for division.

In most cases, it's best to use the division symbol (÷). The division slash is
easily confused with the forward slash which is also used to show alternatives.

In Unicode, the symbol for division is U+00F7 and the division slash is U+2215.

However, division slashes might appear in expressions you have to reproduce in
your content – for example, in algebraic fractions.

The division slash is unspaced. This is a style convention in mathematics. But
consider adding a narrow no-break space around the division slash to make the
expression clearer. You can also use a thin space, but it will break across
lines.

The Unicode characters are:

* division symbol – U+00F7
* division slash – U+2215
* narrow no-break space – U+202F
* thin space – U+2009.

<example> 
* (a + b) ÷ (x + y) [Division symbol with non-breaking spaces]
* (a + b)∕(x + y) [Division slash, unspaced]
* (a + b) ∕ (x + y) [Division slash with narrow no-break spaces]
* (a + b) ∕ (x + y) [Division slash with thin spaces]
* The letters in the examples are called ‘variables’. A variable stands for an unknown number. Write variables in italics. Do not italicise other elements.
</example>

#### Multiplication

Use the mathematical symbol for the multiplication (×). Don’t use the letter
‘x’.

The ‘dot operator’ (Unicode U+22C5) is sometimes used to show multiplication in
mathematical expressions – for example ‘x ⋅ y ’. This is done to avoid confusion
in expressions that contain both the multiplication symbol ‘×’ and a letter ‘x’
used as a variable.

Use the multiplication symbol in general content, not the dot operator. The
multiplication symbol is understood more easily.

Use [non-breaking spaces](##nonbreak) around the multiplication symbol.

In Unicode, the symbol for multiplication is U+00D7.

Programming languages and Excel use the asterisk (\*) for multiplication. The
asterisk has other meanings in algebra, so only use it for multiplication if
users will understand what you mean.

<example> 
* (a + b) × (x + y) [Multiplication symbol with non-breaking spaces]
</example>

#### ‘Greater than’ and ‘less than’

The ‘greater than’ (>) and ‘less than’ (<) symbols are relations used to compare
values.

The symbols > and < can be confusing. Like all symbols, it is better to use
words in general content. This helps users to understand the mathematical
relationship you are writing about.

When research shows that users need the symbols, use [non-breaking
spaces](##nbsp) between the symbol and numbers.

Use your keyboard to insert these symbols; they are coded correctly. You can
also use Word’s Insert>Symbol command or Unicode.

The Unicode characters are:

* greater than – U+003E
* less than – U+003C.

<example> 
 

* 0.7 is less than 0.9 [General content]
* 0.7 < 0.9 [Less than symbol with non-breaking spaces]
</example>

#### ‘Greater than or equal to’ and ‘less than or equal to’

The ‘greater than or equal to’ (≥) and ‘less than’ (≤) relations are commonly
used in algebra.

When research shows that users need the symbols (and algebraic expressions), use
[non-breaking spaces](##nbsp).

Use Word’s Insert>Symbol command or Unicode to insert the symbols.

The Unicode characters are:

* greater than or equal to – U+2265
* less than or equal to – U+2264.

Like all symbols, it is better to use words in general content.

Programming languages use the symbols ‘>=’ and ‘<=’ for these relationships.
Don’t use them in your content, they are not mathematical notation.

<example> 
 

* Our customer satisfaction target is ‘greater than or equal to 90 out of 100’. [Words in general content]
* x ≥ 4 [Symbol in an algebraic expression]
</example>

#### Don’t space >,<, ≥ and ≤ when they refer to a range of numbers

When there is no space between a relation and a number, the expressions shows a
range of numbers. For example, ‘<6.74’ refers to an infinitely large set of real
numbers less than the number 6.74.

In most content, it is better to use words to avoid confusion: ‘less than 6.74’.

<example> 
 

* The authors removed an outlier based on a Body Mass Index of less than 13 and greater than 97.
* Only use petty cash for amounts less than $100.
</example>

### Use a non-breaking space to keep characters and symbols together

Insert a non-breaking space between numbers, letters and the symbol for an
operator or a relation. A non-breaking space means that line breaks won’t
separate a character from its symbol.

You can insert a non-breaking space using the Unicode character U+00A0.

In HTML, use the entity &nbsp; to insert a non-breaking space. You can also use
the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar in Word.

### Don’t use a space if a symbol modifies a value

Symbols that modify a value rather than show an operation or a relationship, do
not need a space.

Non-mathematical terms help to explain this.

When the symbol acts as a mathematical adjective, there is no space between the
symbol and the character it modifies. An example is a positive or negative
amount: +3 and −25.

When the symbol acts as a mathematical conjunction or verb, there are
non-breaking spaces around the symbol. Examples are addition 6 + 6 = 12 and
expressions that compare values such as 9 < 16. There are other examples in
earlier sections on this page.

To avoid confusion in sentences, it is usually better to use words not symbols.

<example> 
 

* The balance is minus $10.
</example>

### Use the correct style for equations

An equation is a statement or question consisting of 2 mathematical expressions
linked by an equals symbol (=).

Use equations if user research supports their inclusion.

The Unicode character for the equals symbol is U+003D.

Put a [non-breaking space](##nonbreak) around the equals symbol and around all
operators except for the division slash – it is unspaced. If you think the
equation is clearer with a space around the division slash, use a narrow
no-break space (U+202F) or thin space (U+2009).

There is no space between a character and its superscript or subscript.

<example> 
##### Correct

 

* 10 + 1 = 11 [Equation with non-breaking spaces around plus and equals]
* xa × xb = xa+b [The index law of multiplication – no space between the variable and superscript exponent]
* xn = xn-1 + xn-2 [Fibonacci sequence written as a rule – no space between the variable and the subscripts showing the variable’s sequence]
</example>

#### Set equations as block quotes

An equation can be set ‘inline’ within a line of text or ‘displayed’ on a line
of its own.

Displayed equations are indented, centred or left-aligned.

For general content, the Style Manual recommends using a displayed equation set
as a block quote. Code the block quote with the HTML <blockquote> element.

Don’t introduce the equation with a colon, but do use other sentence
punctuation. For example, if the equation ends a sentence, follow the equation
with a full stop.>

<example> 
 

In geometrical optics, Newton’s formula for focal length is

f = √xy

where f is focal length, x is object distance and y is image distance.

</example>

Specialist mathematical publications often contain both inline and displayed
equations. Follow the publisher’s style if you write specialist content.

When writing mathematical expressions in Word documents, consider using [Word’s
equation
editor](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/write-an-equation-or-formula-1d01cabc-ceb1-458d-bc70-7f9737722702)
(type ‘Alt+=’ or Insert>Equation). It has built-in style for elements such as
position, non-breaking spaces, font, sizing, bold, italics and superscript.

The equation editor in the most recent versions of Word also allows you to
create and edit [linear format
equations](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/linear-format-equations-using-unicodemath-and-latex-in-word-2e00618d-b1fd-49d8-8cb4-8d17f25754f8).

## Measurement and units

Standard units of measurement support readability and accuracy. Express precise
values for users by combining numerals with the correct unit symbol.

### Use the standard units of measurement

Australia uses the metric system for most quantities:

* The modern form of the metric system is the [International System of Units](https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/ ) (SI).
* Australia also uses some non-SI legal units of measurement, which are listed in [Schedules 1 and 2 of the National Measurement Regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2012C00400).

The National Measurement Institute oversees [Australian units of
measurement](https://www.industry.gov.au/regulations-and-standards/australias-measurement-system).
The governing legislation is the [National Measurement Act
1960](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C1960A00064).

Don’t use the non-SI legal units of measurement for international content. The
exception is when you have checked that  users will understand and accept them.

Rules for units of measurement:

* Punctuation: don’t place a full stop after a unit of measurement.
* Capitalisation: use capitals only if the unit represents a proper name.
* Plural and possessive: units don’t have a plural or possessive form.
* Start of a sentence: write out the unit in full.
* Spacing: use a non-breaking space between the number and the unit.

<example> 
* ‘m’ for metre
* ‘kg’ for kilogram
* ‘W’ for watt
</example>

#### Accessibility requirements

Measurements and units can include:

* symbols (for example, ‘μ’ for ‘micro’)
* superscript (a number, letter or symbol placed above a line – for example, the ‘2’ in ‘km2’).

Unless they are coded correctly, symbols and superscript may be inaccessible for
some people who:

* have low vision
* use screen readers to access content.

Insert symbols and superscript with tools such as:

* [Unicode](https://home.unicode.org/)
* [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
* [Mathematical Markup Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/) (MathML).

These tools make mathematical equations and symbols accessible, including for
screen readers.

Ensure both symbols and superscript can be enlarged without loss of content or
functionality. Don't use images of symbols or superscript.

WCAG quick reference: [1.3.1 Info and relationships – level
A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##info-and-relationships)

### Write numerals with units of measurement

Use numerals, not words, for numbers when you are referring to a unit of
measurement:

* Always use numerals next to a unit of measurement.
* Include a non-breaking space between the number and the unit.

<example> 
* 5 t
* 5 tonnes
</example>

### Use symbols for common units of measurement

You don’t need to spell out units of measurement, even for the first use, if
they’re well known and users will know what they mean.

<example> 
* ‘mm’ for millimetres
* ‘cm’ for centimetres
* ‘km’ for kilometres
* ‘km/h’ for kilometres per hour
</example>

Spell out units of measurement the first time you use them if  users won’t
immediately understand them. After that, use the symbols.

<example> 
The noise from the building site was 120 decibels (dB). Workers in the nearby
office preferred a limit of only 50 dB.

</example>

Don’t combine symbols and words for units.

<example> 
Queensland is 1,853 million km2 in area.

</example>

#### SI prefixes for large and small quantities

Internationally accepted prefixes and their symbols make it easier for users to
read, understand and compare numbers. Use them in government content.

Table 1 details common prefixes and their symbols.

A complete list of prefixes and symbols is available at [The International
Bureau of Weights and Measures
(BIPM)](https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/).

 Table 1: Commonly used prefixes for SI unitsPrefixSymbolFactorExtended formteraT10121,000,000,000,000gigaG1091,000,000,000megaM1061,000,000kilok1031,000hectoh102100deca (also ‘deka’)da10110decid10-10.1centic10-20.01millim10-30.001microµ10-60.000001nanon10-90.000000001

Note: the International Bureau of Weights and Measures uses ‘deca’ but this is
spelled ‘deka’ in [Schedule 3 of the National Measurement
Regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2012C00400).

 <example> 
* 63 megalitres is 63,000,000 litres
* 0.001 metre is 1 millimetre
</example>

Don’t use non-standard units.

<example> 
* There was 5 μg of active ingredient in each capsule.
* He measured 50 mL of water.
</example>

#### Data storage and transfer

The prefixes for data storage and transfer work differently to those used for SI
units. ‘Byte’ (B) is the unit of storage and data transfer speed. For this
purpose, use:

* ‘kilobyte’ for 1,000 B
* ‘megabyte’ for 1,024 kB
* ‘gigabyte’ for 1,024 MB
* ‘terabyte’ for 1,024 GB.

#### Units of time

Days, years, hours and minutes measure time. These are not SI units. Spell them
out in full – unless they’re in a table, list or chart and are easy to
understand.

<example> 
 

* I have been working in the public service for 12 years.
* He started in the new department 20 days ago.
* They sent the report in the last 15 minutes.
</example>

Use symbols for units that are derived from time measurements, such as speed.

<example> 
 

The speed limit for urban areas in NSW is 50 km/h.

</example>

### Put a non-breaking space between numbers and units

People will read the number and its unit as a measurement only if the 2
components sit together. To do this, use a non-breaking space between numbers
and their units of measurement.

Without a non-breaking space, a unit could reflow to the next line. This would
separate it from the quantity, making it difficult for users to understand the
information being presented.

Although this is important for all content, it’s more likely to happen on
smaller screens, such as those on mobile devices.

<example> 
 

The post should be at least 1.5 m tall.

[The sentence has a &nbsp; inserted between ‘1.5’ and ‘m’.]

</example>

By convention, some industries don’t have a space between the quantity and the
unit. Many 750 mL bottles of wine, for example, have the volume 750mL printed on
the label.

Check the preferred style if you are writing for a specialist application.

### Don’t add ‘s’ for plural forms

Symbols for units of measurement represent both the singular and the plural
forms. Don’t use an ‘s’ to show plural with the symbols for units.

<example> 
 

56 km

</example>

### Compare measurements using the same units

Make it easy for users to compare quantities. Use the same:

* unit and prefix
* number of decimal places.

<example> 
 

* The Green Wattle Creek fire burnt almost 3,000 km2, of which more than 1,000 km2 was national park.
* The smaller jug held 1.5 L and the bigger jug held 2.0 L.
* The piece of wood was 140 mm by 1,320 mm by 20 mm.
</example>

### Only use non-SI units if the user understands them

There are other units that are also Australian legal units of measurement but
are not SI units. They’re listed in [Schedules 1 and 2 of the National
Measurement Regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2019C00572).

These non-SI units are not all legally accepted in every country. Use them only
if users will understand them. Some units, such as the nautical mile, are for
use only in Australia. Table 2 details common examples of other legal Australian
units.

Table 2: Examples of other commonly used legal units in AustraliaQualityNameSymbolsound intensitydecibeldBareahectarehalengthnautical milen milemasstonnettimedaydtimehourhtimeminuteminvelocityknotknvolumelitreL or lblood pressuremillimetre of mercurymm Hgwork and energykilocaloriekcal

Note: ‘litre’ can be represented as ‘L’ or ‘l’, depending on the type of content
and who will be using it. Most government content should use ‘L’ as it’s clearer
to users (‘l’ can be confused with ‘I’ and ‘1’).

### Avoid imperial units

Don’t use imperial units of measurement in Australia unless you have a specific
reason, such as:

* in quotations from historical documents
* when writing for readers in countries (particularly the United States) where imperial measures, or elements of them, still apply.

<example> 
 

* gallons for volume of fuel
* barrels for volume of oil
* inches for the size of a screen
* feet for the altitude of a plane
</example>

It’s good practice to also provide the equivalent quantity in SI units when that
helps users.

<example> 
 

In the 1970s, the speed limit for highways in many states of Australia was set
at 60 miles per hour (97 km/h).

</example>

## Ordinal numbers

Ordinal numbers, such as ‘first’, ‘second’ and ‘third’, show the order, position
or importance of things in a list or sequence.

### Use words for ordinals up to ‘ninth’ and numerals for ‘10th’ and above

Spell out ordinal numbers from ‘first’ to ‘ninth’. Use numerals for ordinals
from ‘10th’ onwards.

Ordinals written as numerals always have a suffix:

* ‘-st’ (‘first’, ‘21st’)
* ‘-nd’ (‘second’, ‘32nd’)
* ‘-rd’ (‘third’, ‘103rd’)
* ‘-th’ (‘fourth’, ‘15th’, ‘55th’ and so on).

Don’t write suffixes in superscript. Superscript may not be accessible to people
who use screen readers.

<example>
* The first item on the agenda was to confirm the agenda. The second item was to review the minutes from the last meeting.
* In 2013, Canberra celebrated its 100th anniversary.
* We pause to remember at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.
* This is the department’s 22nd graduate intake.
* We expect to receive our 1,000th visitor today.
* They are the 273rd immigrant to join this group.</example>

#### Exception to ordinals rule for centuries

Use numerals, not words, when writing ordinals with
[centuries](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/dates-and-time##refer_to_specific_days_events_and_periods_with_capitals).
This is an exception to the general rule to spell out ‘first’ to ‘ninth’ for
ordinals.

Write ‘century’ and ‘centuries’ in lower case.

<example>
* In the 1st century CE, Tiberius succeeded Augustus Caesar as Roman emperor.
* Vikings established a Norse kingdom around Dublin in the 9th century.
* The gallery bought a 15th-century painting.</example>

#### Very large ordinals

People find very large rounded numbers easier to read in [words rather than
numerals](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words##combine_numerals_and_words_for_large_rounded_numbers).
This also applies to ordinal numbers. Spell out the number and include the
relevant suffix.

<example>
* the millionth visitor</example>

#### Ordinals in reference lists

In reference lists, use numerals with a suffix for editions of a publication.
This is an exception to the rule to use words for ordinal numbers up to ninth.

<example>
Brone AZ (2020) Towards a high-performing public service, 2nd edn, Positive
Publications, Canberra.</example>

#### Ordinals in organisation names

If an organisation’s name includes a numeral, write the name as the organisation
does. This is an exception to the rule to use words for ordinal numbers up to
ninth.

<example>
The 1st Australian Infantry Battalion arrived in Egypt on 2 December 1914.

MyHealth 1st is a platform that connects patients with local health
practitioners.

They searched for Thirteenth Holdings Pty Ltd on the ASIC registers.</example>

### Create a list rather than use ordinals

Don’t use ordinals to order points in general content. Reword the content so it
doesn’t need ordinals or use a numbered list instead. A list can make it easier
for people to follow the sequence.

Always use numbered lists rather than ordinals when you’re expressing a series
of items or steps – for example, in recommendations or instructions.

<example>
To apply for the grant:

1. complete the eligibility checklist
2. submit a business case
3. provide supporting documents.</example>

#### Accessibility requirements

Code lists so they are understood correctly. Mark up ordered lists in HTML with
the <ol> tag.

WCAG quick reference: [1.3.1 Info and relationships – level
A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##info-and-relationships)

#### Ordinals in journals and other publications

Ordinals, such as ‘firstly’ and ‘secondly’, are sometimes used in content
written for government publications such as journals and reports. In this type
of content, they order thoughts without interrupting the flow of the text.

‘Firstly’ and ‘secondly’ work as a pair. Don’t use one without the other.

<example>
The committee responded in 2 ways. Firstly, they asked for an immediate
adjournment of proceedings. Secondly, they sought clarification about their
powers to subpoena witnesses.</example>

Don’t use ‘thirdly’. Instead, omit ordinals and write the points as a run-on
list in a sentence.

<example>
The committee took evidence from peak bodies, unions and the department.</example>

### Don't use ordinals in dates

Use numerals without a suffix for dates.

<example>
12 February 2020</example>

### Don’t confuse ordinals with regnal numbers

Regnal numbers are upper case roman numerals that are used for the titles of
monarchs and popes and in family names.

Even though you might pronounce regnals as ordinal numbers, don’t write them
like that.

<example>

#### Correct

Elizabeth I</example>

#### Use a non-breaking space for names with regnal numbers

Put a non-breaking space between the name and the regnal number. A non-breaking
space means that line breaks won’t split up both elements of the name. The name
and number will stay together on one line.

You can insert a non-breaking space using the Unicode character U+00A0.

In HTML, use the entity &nbsp; to insert a non-breaking space. You can also use
the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar in Word.

##### Print considerations

Use a narrow no-break space between the name and the regnal number.

The narrow no-break space ensures that the:

* name and number stay together on one line
* spacing between name and number doesn’t change when text is justified.

You can insert a narrow no-break space using the Unicode character U+202F.

## Percentages

Percentages help people compare things and understand proportions. Use numerals
with the percentage sign. Be concise when you write about percentages. 

### Use numerals with the percentage sign

Use the percentage sign next to a numeral in text. Don’t use a space between the
number and the percentage sign.

<example>

#### Correct

15%</example>

Use decimals rather than fractions with the percentage sign.

<example>

#### Correct

The price of Tapis oil is up by 0.25%.</example>

As for any number, avoid starting a sentence with the percentage. Reword the
sentence if possible, or write the percentage out in words. You can use everyday
words if a precise amount is not needed.

<example>
Fifty-five per cent of the council’s revenue came from rates.

Rates accounted for 55% of revenue.</example>

### Use the correct form of the noun (percentage)

‘Per cent’ and ‘percentage’ aren’t the same. The term ‘per cent’ is an adverb.
The noun form is ‘percentage’.

<example>

#### Correct

Statistics show the percentage of Australians with university degrees is
increasing.</example>

‘Per cent’ is written as 2 words in Australia. ‘Percent’ is not Australian
spelling.

### Don’t use percentages to describe change

Avoid using percentages to describe changes.

Tell people what the actual increase or decrease is.

<example>
The application fee is now $70. This is a $20 increase from 1 January 2020.</example>

### Be concise when writing about percentages

When you use many percentages in body text, put the figures in brackets
(parentheses) or use a list to simplify the text.

<example>
In 2019, population size increased in New South Wales (32%), Queensland (20%)
and Victoria (19%).</example>

## Telephone numbers

Write telephone numbers so people can read and use them easily. There are rules
for grouping the numbers, using spacing and creating links.

### Use ‘chunks’ of digits to help people read telephone numbers

Break telephone numbers into shorter blocks of digits or ‘chunks’.

Telephone numbers are easier to read when their digits are chunked, rather than
written in one large group.

Australian telephone numbers in general use have no more than 10 digits:

* Landlines – 2 digits for the area code followed by 8 digits for the rest of the telephone number.
* Mobiles – 10 digits (there is no area code).

There are also categories of telephone numbers that don’t have 10 digits – for
example, ‘13’ numbers have 6 digits.

<example>
* 02 5550 4321 [A landline number in NSW or the ACT]
* 0491 570 159 [An Australian mobile number]
* 1300 975 707 [An Australia-wide local-rate number]
* 13 00 00 [An alternative Australia-wide local-rate number]
* 1800 160 401 [An Australia-wide freephone number]
* +61 2 5550 4321 [An Australian landline number in international format]
* +61 491 570 159 [An Australian mobile number in international format]</example>

### Put a non-breaking space between the chunks of digits

Use a non-breaking space between chunks of digits in a telephone number. A
non-breaking space means that line breaks won’t split up the number. The
telephone number will stay together on one line.

You can insert a non-breaking space using the Unicode character U+00A0.

In HTML, use the entity &nbsp; to insert a non-breaking space. You can also use
the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar in Word.

#### Print considerations

Use a narrow no-break space between chunks of digits in a telephone number.

The narrow no-break space ensures that the:

* telephone number stays together on one line
* spacing between digits doesn’t change when text is justified.

You can insert a narrow no-break space using the Unicode character U+202F.

### Write telephone numbers in the national or international format

Write telephone numbers in a format appropriate for the location of the users.

#### National format for telephone numbers

Use Australia’s national format when writing Australian telephone numbers for
content that will be used within Australia.

For landline telephone numbers, write the 2-digit area code followed by a
non-breaking space. Then write the rest of the number in 2 chunks of 4 digits.

Write mobile telephone numbers in 1 chunk of 4 digits and then 2 chunks of 3
digits.

<example>
* 02 5550 4321 [Telephone]
* 0491 570 159 [Mobile]</example>

#### International format for telephone numbers

Use international format for content that will be used outside Australia.

The international format uses a plus sign ’+’ to represent the international
prefix, followed by a country code (‘61’ for Australia).

For landline numbers:

* start with a plus sign ‘+’ and add the country code (‘61’ for Australia)
* add the area code without the ‘0’
* write the telephone number in 2 chunks of 4 digits.

<example>
* +61 3 7010 4321 [Landline]</example>

For mobile numbers:

* start with a plus sign ‘+’ and add the country code (‘61’ for Australia)
* omit the first ‘0’
* write the telephone number in 3 chunks of 3 digits.

<example>
+61 491 578 888 [Mobile]</example>

Always write foreign telephone numbers in the international format.

<example>
* +1 212 555 0188 [US landline]
* +44 20 7946 0990 [UK landline]</example>

### Make telephone numbers accessible through ‘click-to-call’ functionality

‘Click-to-call’ allows users to call a telephone number by selecting (clicking)
the number shown in content. When the user selects the number, the user’s mobile
phone, other mobile device or personal computer (if it has a supporting
application) calls the number.

Click-to-call makes telephone numbers more accessible because users don’t need
to copy the number manually. Click-to-call also works with screen readers.

Devices sometimes recognise when a number in content is a telephone number and
automatically treat the number as a click-to-call link. This is not always the
case, so use HTML code to support this functionality. Seek specialist advice if
you’re unsure of how to do this.

#### Using HTML for click-to-call

Use ‘tel:[telephone number]’ as the URL. Remove spaces between the numbers.

Remember that all webpages can be accessed internationally. Include the
international dialling prefix if appropriate.

<example>
* [02 5550 5722](tel:0255500000) [HTML: <a href="tel:0255505722">02&nbsp;5550&nbsp;5722</a>]
* [1300 975 7007](tel:13009757007) [HTML: <a href="tel:13009757007">1300&nbsp;975&nbsp;7007</a>]
* [13 83 87](tel:138387) [HTML: <a href="tel:138387">13&nbsp;83&nbsp;87</a>]
* [1800 160 401](tel:1800160401) [HTML: <a href="tel:1800160401">1800&nbsp;160&nbsp;401</a>]
* [+61 2 7010 0000](tel:+61270100000) [HTML: <a href="tel:+61270100000">+61&nbsp;2&nbsp;7010&nbsp;0000</a>]
* [+61 491 570 156](tel:+61491570156) [HTML: <a href="tel:+61491570156">+61&nbsp;491&nbsp;570&nbsp;156</a>]</example>

### Don't use ‘phone words’

Always display the telephone number as digits. Don’t use ‘phone words’. Use the
relevant 13 or 1300 number instead.

Some organisations use phone words to advertise their telephone number as a
digit-word combination. Don’t do this, because some people find it hard to
convert letters to numbers.

<example>
13 83 87</example>

## Parts of sentences

A sentence is a group of words that makes sense on its own. Structure the parts
of a sentence so meaning is easy to understand.

### A full sentence is grammatically complete

Sentences can be statements, questions, exclamations or commands. A full
sentence expresses a complete idea.

Sentences contain at least a subject and a verb.

A basic sentence can have more components, for example:

* who did something (the subject)
* what they did (the verb)
* who or what they did it to (the object or complement).

The verb plus the object or complement form the ‘predicate’. Not all sentences
contain an object or complement as part of the predicate.

A subject and verb can be enough to complete the subject–predicate structure of
a sentence.

<example> 
* The manager moved. [The subject is ‘the manager’. The verb or predicate is ‘moved’.]
* The manager moved their desk. [The subject is ‘the manager’. The verb is ‘moved’ and the object or complement is ‘their desk’. ‘Moved their desk’ is the predicate.]
</example>

The predicate can sometimes appear as a whole sentence because the subject is
implied. This can depend on [the ‘mood’ of the verb](/node/128).

<example> 
* Sign in. [The implied subject is ‘you’. The predicate is ‘sign in’.]
* Confirm your password. [The implied subject is ‘you’. The predicate is the verb ‘confirm’, plus the object or complement ‘your password’.]
</example>

#### Subject

The subject is the person or thing that is doing the action in the sentence. The
subject can be a pronoun, noun, noun phrase or noun clause.

<example> 
* They met in the boardroom. [‘They’ is the subject.]
* People use the website to find information. [‘People’ is the subject.]
* The Digital Service Standard has 13 criteria. [‘The Digital Service Standard’ is the subject.]
* The heavy rain that fell last week subdued the fire. [‘The heavy rain that fell last week’ is the subject.]
</example>

A noun phrase that is part of the subject is partially formed by [determiners
(such as ‘the’)](/node/132).

#### Verb

The verb carries information about the subject. It affects the object or
complement (if there is one). It can convey an action, an event, a change or a
state.

<example> 
* They met in the boardroom. [‘met’ is the verb]
* The meeting finished early. [‘finished’ is the verb]
* They were all late. [‘were’ is the verb]
</example>

#### Objects and complements

An object is the thing, person or concept that complements the verb. Objects can
be direct or indirect.

<example> 
* Ravi sent clear instructions to the team.
* [‘Clear instructions’ is the direct object of the verb ‘sent’. ‘The team’ is the indirect object of the verb. Both objects plus the verb form the predicate.]
</example>

Some verbs have no action. They have complements that describe a quality or
characteristic of the subject.

<example> 
* Mary is the new office manager.
* [‘Mary’ is the subject. ‘The new office manager’ complements the verb ‘is’. The complement plus the verb forms the predicate.]
</example>

### Sentences are simple, compound or complex

#### Simple sentences

A simple sentence contains only one [main (or principal) clause](/node/143).
This means it has only one complete verb in it.

<example> 
The Senate voted on the Aged Care Bill. [‘The Senate’ is the subject. The verb
is ‘voted’. ‘On the Aged Care Bill’ complements the verb to form the predicate.]

</example>

The subject can be implied by using a verb in the imperative mood.

<example> 
Enter your verification code. [The implied subject is ‘you’. The verb is
‘enter’. ‘Your verification code’ complements the verb to form the predicate.]

</example>

#### Compound sentences

A compound sentence contains 2 or more main clauses joined by a coordinating
conjunction (‘and’, ‘or’, ‘but’, ‘so’). Each clause has a complete verb and
could stand on its own.

If they have different subjects, use a comma before the coordinating
conjunction.

<example> 
 

The agency planned to start the project next year, but the group ran out of
funding. [‘But’ is the coordinating conjunction that joins the 2 main clauses.]

</example>

If the 2 clauses share the same subject, don’t repeat the subject or insert a
comma before the conjunction.

<example> 
 

The agency planned to start the project next year but ran out of funding. [‘The
agency’ is the subject of the verb ‘planned’ and the implied subject of the verb
‘ran out’.]

</example>

You could also write this as 2 short sentences, but this approach can appear
repetitive.

<example> 
##### Example

 The agency planned to start the project next year. The agency ran out of funding. [‘The agency’ is the subject of both sentences.]</example>

#### Complex sentences

A complex sentence contains a main clause and at least one [subordinate
clause](/node/143##subordinate_clauses_depend_on_the_main_clause).

You can start the sentence with the main clause.

<example> 
##### Example

 

She finished the report before she left work. [The focus of the sentence is that
‘she finished the report’, which is the main clause.]

</example>

You can also start the sentence with the subordinate clause to change the
emphasis.

<example> 
##### Example

 

Before she left work, she finished the report. [The focus of the sentence is
that she finished ‘before she left work’, which is the subordinate clause.]

</example>

### Passive voice changes standard sentence order

Simple subject–verb–object sentences are standard in English. This order is
clearer and more accessible for people.

Build most sentences in this order with active voice when using active verbs
(doing or action verbs).

In passive voice, the ‘agent’ of an active verb is not the grammatical subject
in the sentence order. Using active verbs with passive voice disguises who is
doing what.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* Wind forecasts are produced to show average speeds. [Passive voice: the grammatical subject is ‘wind forecasts’. It does not answer the question, ‘Who or what produces wind forecasts?’]
* Wind forecasts are produced by computer models to show average speeds. [Passive voice with modified sentence structure: ‘by computer models’ is an [adverbial phrase](/node/144). It answers the question, ‘Who or what produces wind forecasts?’]
* Computer models produce wind forecasts to show average speeds. [Active voice: the subject of the verb matches the answer to the question, ‘Who or what produces wind forecasts?’]
</example>

Use passive voice only if there is a good reason – for example, if you can’t say
who did the action or because information has to be concealed for ethical or
legal reasons.

<example> 
#### Example

 

A formal complaint was made about the use of discriminatory language.

</example>

## Clauses

Clauses are building blocks: sentences can have one or more. When they’re well
structured, clauses give people clear information.

### Clauses contain at least one verb

A clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb.

A clause can be:

* a main clause
* a subordinate clause – noun, adjectival or adverbial.

A main clause can usually stand alone as a sentence, but a subordinate clause
can’t.

### A main clause can stand alone as a sentence

Every sentence has at least one main clause. The main clause is also known as:

* a principal clause
* an independent clause.

The main clause has at least one complete (finite) verb and can stand alone as a
sentence.

<example> 
We will price the project accurately.

[The entire sentence is a main clause.]

When we know the final cost estimates, we will price the project accurately.

[The main clause is ‘we will price the project accurately’.]

</example>

A compound sentence contains 2 or more main clauses joined by a [coordinating
conjunction](/node/129##coordinating_conjunctions_join_things_of_equal_importance).
Each clause has a complete verb and could stand on its own.

<example> 
We will price the project accurately and it will finish on time.

[There are 2 main clauses in this sentence, joined by the coordinating
conjunction ‘and’.]

</example>

### Subordinate clauses depend on the main clause

A subordinate clause can’t stand alone as a sentence. Subordinate clauses depend
on the main clause to make sense. This is why they are also called ‘dependent
clauses’.

Types of subordinate clauses are:

* noun clause
* adjectival clause
* adverbial clause.

#### Noun clauses

Noun clauses act as [nouns](/node/122) in a sentence, even though they may
consist of other types of words. You can replace a noun clause with ‘it’ and the
sentence will still make sense.

<example> 
How you are still working is a mystery. / It is a mystery.

[‘How you are still working’ is a noun clause.]

</example>

Noun clauses often start with a:

* relative pronoun – such as ‘that’ or ‘who’
* subordinating conjunction – such as ‘although’ or ‘because’.

<example> 
That Canberra winters are cold is well known. / It is well known.

[‘That Canberra winters are cold’ is a noun clause.]

</example>

They can also start with a verb in its basic form, which means it has the word
‘to’ (such as ‘to sleep’, ‘to sit’).

<example> 
He learned to Skype. / He learned it.

[‘To Skype’ is a noun clause.]

</example>

#### Adjectival clauses

An adjectival (or relative) clause acts as an [adjective](/node/126). It
describes a noun.

Adjectival clauses are usually, but not always, introduced by a relative pronoun
(such as ‘that’, ‘which’, ‘who’, ‘whom’, ‘whose’).

The sentence should still make sense if you remove the adjectival clause.

<example> 
The office, which is in the city, closed for the day. / The office closed for
the day.

[‘Which is in the city’ is an adjectival clause.]

This is the committee that met for 12 hours last Tuesday. / This is the
committee.

[‘That met for 12 hours last Tuesday’ is an adjectival clause.]

The manager, whose staff work hard, often stays back late. / The manager often
stays back late.

[‘Whose staff work hard’ is an adjectival clause.]

</example>

#### Adverbial clauses

Adverbial clauses stand in for [adverbs](/node/127). They describe time, place,
manner, reason, condition, purpose or concession.

The sentence should still make sense if you remove the adverbial clause.

<example> 
I always eat breakfast before I go to work. / I always eat breakfast.

[‘Before I go to work’ is an adverbial clause.]

</example>

Adverbial clauses are usually, but not always, introduced by:

* a relative pronoun – such as ‘that’, ‘which’, ‘who’, ‘whom’, ‘whose’
* a preposition.

<example> 
* I always check all my emails before I respond.  [Adverbial clause of time]
* Let’s meet where there are videoconferencing facilities. [Adverbial clause of place]
* She works as well as any other staff member. [Adverbial clause of manner]
* I’m late for work because I missed the bus. [Adverbial clause of reason]
* I’ll dial into the meeting if the server is working. [Adverbial clause of condition]
* Please approve the $20 expense so that I can pay for the stationery. [Adverbial clause of purpose]
* Although the deadline was almost upon her, she had a rest during the weekend. [Adverbial clause of concession]
</example>

In the last example, the comma after the adverbial clause helps users find the
subject in the sentence (‘she’).

In some sentences, the subject isn’t easy to find without the
[comma](/node/109##mark_out_nonessential_information_within_a_sentence).

<example> 
##### Correct

 

When I met with Eun-jung, Deng met with Evelyn.

[‘Deng’ is the subject of the main clause.]

</example>

#### Conjunctions ‘if’ and ‘whether’

‘If’ and ‘whether’ are both subordinating conjunctions. They can often be 
interchangeable, particularly in spoken English. Yet they have different
meanings. When you’re writing, choose the right one:

* ‘If’ is conditional. It defines a condition that needs to exist for the main clause to be true.
* ‘Whether’ shows 2 possibilities. Sometimes one of the possibilities can be understood rather than explicitly mentioned.

<example> 
 

We can eat lunch outside if the rain stops.

[The condition for eating lunch outside is that the rain stops.]

We can choose whether to eat lunch outside or inside.

[There are 2 places to eat lunch.]

We asked whether the office was open [or not].

[The ‘or not’ is implied. The office could be open or not open.]

</example>

When there are 2 concrete possibilities, using ‘if’ instead of ‘whether’ can
lead to ambiguous sentences.

<example> 
 

We asked whether he was working from home or from the office.

[Was he working from home or was he working from the office?]

We asked if he was working from home or from the office.

[Was he working at all, regardless of the location?]

</example>

## Phrases

Phrases are groups of words that add meaning to a sentence. Write and punctuate
them correctly to give people clear and useful information.

### Phrases are groups of words with a specific function

A phrase is a group of words that makes sense on its own but doesn’t contain a
subject and a verb.

Phrases can only add meaning to a sentence. They can’t stand on their own.

Types of phrases include:

* noun phrases
* adverbial phrases
* adjectival phrases.

### Noun phrases function as nouns

A noun phrase is a group of words that works in a sentence as a
[noun](/node/122). A noun phrase always includes a noun. It can also include
determiners, adjectives, adverbs and other nouns.

<example> 
Our well-prepared colleague entered the meeting room.

[The phrase ‘our well-prepared colleague’ works as the noun in the sentence.
This phrase contains the determiner ‘our’, the adjective ‘well-prepared’ and the
noun ‘colleague’.]

She was well suited to life in an office.

[The phrase ‘life in an office’ works as the noun in the sentence. This phrase
contains the noun ‘life’, the preposition ‘in’, the determiner ‘an’ and the noun
‘office’.]

</example>

#### Possessive phrases

A possessive phrase is a particular type of noun phrase. It shows that one noun
in the phrase belongs to another noun in the phrase. Possessive phrases usually
have an apostrophe.

<example> 
I thought it was someone else’s problem.

[The problem belongs to someone else.]

This was one of the commander-in-chief’s first orders to the troops.

[The first orders belong to the commander-in-chief.]

</example>

#### Non-possessive and generic phrases

Non-possessive and generic phrases use plural nouns as adjectives. No
apostrophes are needed.

<example> 
She signed the visitors book.

[The book doesn’t belong to the visitors. The word ‘visitors’ describes the type
of book.]

The Historic Shipwrecks Delegates Committee met once a year.

[The committee is made up of delegates. The name of the committee relates to the
Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976.]

</example>

### Adverbial phrases function as adverbs

An adverbial phrase is a group of words that describes a verb, adjective or
other [adverb](/node/127).

<example> 
Grammar rules are quite frequently misunderstood.

[The phrase ‘quite frequently’ modifies the adjective ‘misunderstood’.]

Best of all, we can tick this off the list.

[The phrase ‘best of all’ modifies the main clause ‘we can tick this off the
list’.]

</example>

Adverbial phrases can describe the manner of or reason for a verb’s action.

<example> 
We’ll do this by the rules. [Adverbial phrase of manner]

We came inside because of the rain. [Adverbial phrase of reason]

</example>

Adverbial phrases can also describe time and place. These are known as
‘prepositional phrases’. Prepositional phrases consist of:

* the preposition
* any adjectives or determiners that accompany it.

<example> 
I’ll see you after knock-off time. [Adverbial phrase of time]

The manual sat on the shelf. [Adverbial phrase of place]

</example>

### Adjectival phrases function as adjectives

An adjectival phrase is a group of words that works as an
[adjective](/node/126). It modifies a pronoun, noun or noun phrase.

<example> 
The staff showcased their work on the new project.

[The phrase ‘on the new project’ describes the staff’s work.]

</example>

Adjectival phrases that modify a pronoun, noun or noun phrase can also appear
after the verb ‘to be’.

<example> 
They are eager to hear good news.

[The phrase ‘eager to hear good news’ describes the pronoun ‘they’.]

The developer was categorical about accessibility requirements.

[The phrase ‘categorical about accessibility requirements’ describes the noun
phrase ‘the developer’.]

</example>

Adjectival phrases can start with a preposition. They are also known as
prepositional phrases.

<example> 
 

The top line in the budget report showed a deficit.

[The preposition ‘in’ starts the prepositional phrase ‘in the budget report’,
which describes ‘the top line’.]

</example>

## Brackets and parentheses

Brackets can help users scan text more easily. Only use brackets if you can
remove the enclosed text and the meaning does not change.

### Use brackets for text users can skip over

Brackets can help you break up information. They enclose parts of the sentence
that aren’t essential to the meaning. Sentences must be grammatically correct if
you remove the text in brackets.

The most commonly used brackets are:

* parentheses
* square brackets.

Use brackets sparingly for:

* non-essential information
* [shortened forms](/node/92)
* references
* insertions.

Use brackets only where they make content clearer to people. For example, always
use brackets in [author–date
citations](/node/165##examples_of_authordate_citations).

Too many brackets, or badly used brackets, can make a sentence more complex and
difficult to understand. You can usually rewrite a sentence so the content in
brackets can be its own sentence or can even be removed.

Other types of brackets, such as curly brackets and slant brackets, are used in
fields such as mathematics and linguistics. These are specialist uses, so don’t
use them in most content.

### Put extra information in parentheses

Information in parentheses is less important than information that is between
[spaced en dashes](/node/199) or pairs of [commas](/node/109).

Used well, parentheses can improve meaning and make content easy to scan.

#### Definitions

Parentheses enclose definitions.

<example> 
Medicare (Australia’s universal health insurance scheme) guarantees all
Australians access to a wide range of health and hospital services.

</example>

#### Shortened forms

Parentheses introduce a shortened form after it has been spelt out in full. You
can then use the shortened form through the rest of the page or publication.

<example> 
The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is responsible for
research funding and health guidelines.

</example>

#### Cross-references

Parentheses enclose cross-references to other parts of the content.

<example> 
Australia’s population increased by 350,000 people last year (Table 1).

</example>

#### Citations

Parentheses enclose citations in the author–date system of referencing.

<example> 
China is Australia’s largest trading partner (Smith 2019).

</example>

#### Extra detail

Parentheses enclose extra detail.

<example> 
Our 2 biggest exports are iron ore ($61.4 billion) and coal ($60.4 billion).

The winning tenderer (which was a local company) signed the contract on Tuesday.

</example>

#### Clarification and asides

Parentheses enclose text that doesn’t have a grammatical relationship to the
rest of the sentence. This type of text includes extra information,
clarifications and asides.

<example> 
The department was in a heritage-listed building. (The building was designed by
award-winning architect Enrico Taglietti.)

Whitlam’s comments on the steps of Parliament House (‘Well may we say ...’) are
still widely quoted.

</example>

### Avoid using square brackets in parentheses

Reword the text to avoid square brackets inside of parentheses wherever
possible.

<example> 
Australia’s Parliament House opened on 9 May 1988. The architects were
Mitchell/Giurgola & Thorp (New York).

</example>

Don’t use sets of parentheses inside each other. Instead, use square brackets if
you must put parenthetical information within parentheses.

<example> 
Australia’s Parliament House (architects Mitchell/Giurgola & Thorp [New York])
opened on 9 May 1988.

</example>

### Use square brackets to show insertions in quotes

Use square brackets in [quoted material](/node/114) to show that you have:

* paraphrased the original content
* inserted text that was not in the original content.

<example> 
 

He wrote in the report, ‘The department’s executive moved into new offices in
Barton [Canberra] last year.’

‘The High Court [in Canberra] is the highest court in the land,’ she said.

</example>

You can also use square brackets to clarify quoted material.

<example> 
 

The manager reported, ‘Smith was furious with Jackson because he [Smith] wanted
all the credit.’

</example>

Square brackets with an italicised ‘sic’ show that the error in the text is from
the original writer.

<example> 
 

Written late at night, the report began, ‘The office was previously in Melberne
[sic].’

</example>

### Follow normal punctuation rules for content in brackets

Punctuation in brackets depends on what is inside the brackets. Punctuate
content in brackets as you would if it were outside the brackets.

<example> 
#### Example

 

Whitlam’s comments on the steps of Parliament House (‘Well may we say ...’) are
still widely quoted.

</example>

A comma follows a closing bracket only if you would have used a comma if there
were no brackets.

<example> 
#### Correct

 

The winning tenderer (a local company) signed the contract on Tuesday.

</example>

If the content inside the brackets is a full sentence, include the end
punctuation inside the brackets.

<example> 
#### Example

 

The department was in a heritage-listed building. (The building was designed by
award-winning architect Enrico Taglietti.)

</example>

Don’t use brackets to enclose a sentence within a sentence. Rewrite the text
instead.

<example> 
#### Correct

 

The winning tenderer signed the contract on Tuesday. They were a local company.

The winning tenderer (a local company) signed the contract on Tuesday.

</example>

### Write brackets in the same type as the surrounding text

Brackets should be in the same type (roman, italics, bold) as the text around
the brackets. This is regardless of the type of the text inside the brackets.

This is the same rule as for [quotation marks](/node/114).

<example> 
#### Correct

 

The most recent review of defence policy (2016 Defence white paper) set the
direction for the next 10 years. [In this example, the parentheses are not in
italics because the surrounding text is not in italics.]

</example>

## Ellipses

Ellipses show users that ideas or words are missing from a sentence or a quote.
Don’t use ellipses to change the intent of the original source.

### Show missing words or ideas with ellipses

The ellipsis (plural ‘ellipses’) is a character of exactly 3 dots.

Use the ellipsis:

* if you omit words in quoted text
* to mark an unfinished [phrase, clause or sentence](/node/120).

<example> 
* The report is well written, but it needs a thorough review … There is an obvious need for more work.
* Whitlam’s speech on the steps of Parliament House (‘Well may we say …’) is still widely quoted.
</example>

If there is an ellipsis in the original text you’re quoting, add the phrase
‘ellipsis in original’ in square brackets after the quote. Use the same font as
the surrounding text.

<example> 
The minister wrote, ‘The policy settings were … comprehensive’ [ellipsis in
original].

</example>

Don’t use a full stop, comma or semicolon after an ellipsis.

<example> 
The review clarified that the Army might have to fight on home ground … To be
properly equipped, the Army needs a new troop carrier.

</example>

You can use a question mark or exclamation mark after an ellipsis if necessary.

<example> 
I’ve written hundreds of reports: annual reports, white papers …!

</example>

If a paragraph or more is omitted from a [block quotation](/node/114), you can
place the ellipsis on a line of its own.

<example> 
The review clarified that the Army might have to fight on home ground.

…

During exercises, ADF personnel were tasked with tracking down enemy troops from
the mythical nation of Musoria.

</example>

### Do not use a string of full stops

Use the symbol for the ellipsis. Don’t use a string of full stops. Insert it
using:

* the unicode character U+2026
* the HTML code <&##8230;>
* in many software applications, Alt+Ctrl+. or Option;.

### Add spaces around ellipses

Use a single space before and after each ellipsis.

<example> 
#### Correct
The evaluation concluded, ‘The report is well written, but it needs … more
work.’

</example>

  <example> 
#### Correct
The evaluation concluded, ‘The report is well written, but …’

</example>

The exception to this rule is if the quote ends in an exclamation mark or
question mark. Include the final punctuation mark after the ellipsis. Don’t
include a space between the punctuation and the ellipsis.

<example> 
He asked, ‘What does the Army do during exercises …?’

</example>

### Don’t change the original intent of quoted material

Use ellipses sparingly. Overusing ellipses can lead to a suspicion that you are
misquoting. Don’t leave out important details or change the original intent of
the quoted material.

<example> 
 

The report is well written, but it needs rewriting now circumstances have
changed … There is now an obvious need for more work.

</example>

## Exclamation marks

Exclamation marks show emphasis and convey emotion. Only use them in informal
content.

### Don’t use exclamation marks in general

Exclamation marks aren’t part of [government voice](/node/40). Don’t use
exclamation marks in formal content, such as government reports or briefings.

In general use, exclamation marks can emphasise:

* statements
* emotions
* greetings
* commands
* rhetorical questions.

<example> 
* That can’t be true!
* Stand at ease!
</example>

Use them sparingly in less formal content such as promotional material and
social media posts. Be aware that exclamation marks can create a sense of panic
or stress.

<example> 
Congratulations to our 2020 Australia Day Award recipients!

Happy international mother language day! ##ourAPS believes in the importance of
cultural and linguistic diversity (CALD) for a sustainable and harmonious
Australian society.

</example>

Exclamation marks often appear ‘as themselves’ in instructions to users of
government services.

<example> 
Your password can have any of the following characters: ! @ ## $ % ^ & \*

</example>

### Write one exclamation mark: don’t overuse them

Don’t use exclamation marks too often. Exclamation marks can lose their emphasis
if you use too many.

At the end of each sentence you want to emphasise, use only one exclamation
mark.

<example> 
Were you born overseas or have a parent who was? Nearly half of Australians do!

</example>

Some people use multiple exclamation marks in [social media](/node/43). This is
not suitable for government content.

## Full stops

Full stops mark the end of sentences which aren't questions or exclamations.
Users need them to scan text and to recognise decimal values.

### Complete a sentence with a full stop

Full stops mark the end of a sentence that is not a question or an exclamation.  

Following the same rule, use full stops at the end of the last item in a [list
that’s made up of sentence
fragments](/node/56##lists_can_be_fragments_whole_sentences_and_standalone_items).

<example> 
The committee met yesterday. It discussed:

* office space
* working hours
* managers’ salaries.
</example>
Use the final full stop because this type of list is a sentence presented as
points to make it easier to read.    

### Use full stops with some numbers and shortened forms

Also use full stops:

* as the decimal point in numbers and currency – for example, ‘$3.55’
* in numbering subsections and paragraphs in a document – for example, ‘Section 7.3’
* in some [Latin shortened forms](/node/91) and [shortened forms used in referencing](/node/92).

Don’t use full stops with [contractions](/node/191) or most
[abbreviations](/node/184).

### Don’t end web or email addresses with full stops

Do not use a full stop after a web or email address if it’s part of a sentence
fragment or on a line by itself.

<example> 
Website: [department.gov.au](##) Email: [example@department.gov.au](##)

</example>

Write full stops in email and web addresses when you use the full form rather
than link text (for example, ‘dfat.gov.au’ instead of linking ‘the DFAT
website’).

### Ensure link text doesn’t include a full stop

Use full stops at the end of sentences with link text, but don’t include the
full stop in the link itself.

<example> 
#### Correct
The People team manages the [add a new employee form](##).

</example>

### Write headings, measurements and captions without full stops

Don’t use full stops in:

* [headings](/node/51)
* [stand-alone lists](/node/56##lists_can_be_fragments_whole_sentences_and_standalone_items) (stand-alone lists have a heading without a colon)
* page headers or footers.

Full stops do not go after:

* symbols or [units of measurement](/node/147) (unless the symbol or unit is also at the end of a sentence)
* [captions and titles](/node/49).

### Don’t add a full stop after hashtags, emojis or handles

Use correct punctuation in government [social media](/node/43). You don’t need a
full stop if your post ends in:

* a web address (URL)
* a tag or handle
* a hashtag
* an emoji
* a sentence fragment.

### Punctuate text messages (SMS) correctly

In government text messages, use correct punctuation and grammar to avoid
ambiguity. Correct writing shows people that the text is authoritative and
trustworthy.

Include a full stop at the end of a text message if it finishes with a sentence.
Don’t include a full stop if the message ends with a fragment or sign off.

<example> 
Warning: there is a high probability of hail in your area. Please take
appropriate precautions and stay safe. Time sent: 4:30 pm AEST

</example>

## Question marks

Users expect direct questions and requests to end with a question mark. Indirect
questions, commands and rhetorical questions can take other punctuation.

### Question marks usually go after the last letter in a sentence

Like other punctuation marks, question marks stay with the text they refer to.
Usually, this is immediately after the last letter of the last word of the
sentence.

#### Brackets and quotation marks change the position of question marks

For brackets and quotation marks, place the question mark:

* before a closing bracket or quotation mark if the question is part of the text in the brackets or quotation marks
* after the closing bracket or quotation mark if the question is part of the surrounding text.

<example> 
###### Question mark before the closing bracket or quote

She asked, ‘Is the report due on Tuesday?’

They decided (and why wouldn’t they?) to cancel the program.

###### Question mark after the closing bracket or quote

What did she mean by ‘the report is due ASAP’?

Did they decide to cancel the program (the EDTA program)?

</example>

#### Inserted question marks can show uncertainty

Question marks can express doubt and uncertainty about dates or other specific
details.

<example> 
John Limeburner (?1743–1785) was a convict who arrived in Australia on the First
Fleet.

Pery Baylee (1784–?) was commandant of Macquarie Harbour penal station in Van
Diemen’s Land from 1831 to 1833.

</example>

### Direct questions and requests end in a question mark

Direct questions end with a question mark. Most begin with one of these words:

* ‘who’, what’, ‘when’, ‘where’, ‘why’, how’, ‘which’, ‘whose’
* ‘are’, ‘is’, ‘was’, ‘were’
* ‘has’, have’
* ‘did’, ‘do’, ‘does’
* ‘can’, ‘will’, ‘could’, ‘would’, ‘should’, ‘might’.

These types of questions are called interrogative sentences.

<example> 
* Who will attend the meeting next week?
* Whose turn is it to take the minutes?
* Are you ready to start the meeting?
* Have they finished voting?
* Did you attend the meeting?
* Will the new government deliver a budget surplus?
* Could you please make your changes by tomorrow?
</example>

Some sentences don’t start with one of the words such as ‘who’, ‘could’ and
‘does’ but still end with a question mark.

<example> 
That’s your proposal?

</example>

Sometimes questions are tagged on to the end of another clause.

<example> 
They would say that, wouldn’t they?

</example>

Requests are often framed as questions. Requests suggest that people have the
option of saying ‘no’.

<example> 
* Can you consider who your future colleagues might be?
* Can you please upload your edits?
</example>

### Indirect questions and commands don’t use a question mark

Indirect questions don’t end with question marks, even if they include a word
such as ‘who’ or ‘does’.

<example> 
He asked who will attend the meeting next week.

</example>

Indirect questions are often used in headings.

<example> 
* Who we are [Heading]
* How to submit a claim [Heading]
</example>

To turn indirect questions into direct questions you can:

* rearrange the words so the verb comes before the subject
* introduce a word such as ‘can’ or ‘why’ – but make sure there is a subject.

<example> 
 

* Who are we?
* How do I submit a claim?
</example>

Guidance in this manual recommends to [avoid questions as
headings](/node/51##write_headings_that_are_clear_and_short), except for [Easy
Read materials](/node/63).

Spellcheckers often recommend that you change indirect questions to end with a
question mark. This isn’t always correct. It depends on whether you are asking a
question.

Instructions and commands aren’t framed as questions. They don’t start with
words such as ‘what’, ‘are’ or ‘does’, and don’t end with a question mark.

Commands and instructions don’t suggest that people have a choice.

<example> 
 

* Consider who your future colleagues might be.
* Please upload your edits.
</example>

### Rhetorical questions end in a question mark or exclamation mark

Depending on the context, a rhetorical question can end in a question mark or an
exclamation mark. Exclamation marks add emphasis – this can make a rhetorical
question sound blunt.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* Will you ever stop asking questions?
* Will you ever stop asking questions!
</example>

## Semicolons

Semicolons link sentences. They complicate sentences for users if overused. Do
not use them at the end of bullet and numbered list items.

### Avoid using a semicolon to link sentences

Short, simple sentences are easier to read. Overusing semicolons makes
writing more difficult to understand.

Semicolons can create a break that is stronger than a comma but weaker than a
full stop. They can link 2 sentences that share or develop an idea. The
information must be closely related.

<example> 
* He wrote a report for each group. The red report was for one group; the blue report was for the other.
* Sometimes it’s optional; sometimes it’s compulsory.
</example>

Instead of a semicolon, it’s usually best to use either:

* a full stop followed by a new sentence
* a comma before the last item, followed by a [conjunction](/node/129).

Sentences should be in plain language and no longer than 25 words. Don’t use a
semicolon if all it does is make your sentence longer.

<example> 
Find out if it’s optional or compulsory before you start. Ask someone to help
you if you don’t know the difference.

</example>

Too much punctuation makes text crowded and difficult to read. If a sentence has
a lot of punctuation marks, it might be a sign that the sentence is too long or
complex. Try to rewrite into [shorter, clearer sentences](/node/204).

If you have to use a semicolon, on both sides of the semicolon write [full
sentences](/node/120). Other than in some sentence lists, it’s incorrect to have
a sentence fragment on one side of the semicolon.

<example> 
#### Correct
Staff can leave at any time; they don’t need a work schedule.

</example>

### Don’t end bullet and numbered list items with semicolons

You don’t need a semicolon at the end of each list item for bullet and numbered
[lists](/node/56). It clutters the list and makes it hard to read.

<example> 
The successful applicant will demonstrate:

* integrity, persistence and good judgement
* experience in projects of this type
* a sound understanding of interdepartmental relationships.
</example>

### Separate in-text references with semicolons

Use a semicolon between each reference when you have more than one in-text
[reference in brackets](/node/181).

<example> 
Effective leaders are adaptable (Nicoll 2019; Taylor 2018; Weir 2020).

</example>

### Use a bullet or numbered list instead of semicolons in a complex sentence

Complex lists in sentences can be hard to read. If you can’t use a bullet or
numbered list, separate list items with:

* commas if the list is simple, such as a list of single words
* semicolons if the list is complex, such as a list of items that already contain commas or conjunctions.

In complex lists, you need semicolons to show what goes with what.

It is almost always better to break a complex list into a bullet or numbered
list to make it easier to read.

<example> 
The successful applicant will demonstrate integrity, persistence and confidence.
[No semicolon is needed, as each item is a single word or phrase with no other
punctuation.]

The successful applicant will demonstrate integrity, persistence and confidence;
experience in projects of this type; and a sound understanding of
interdepartmental relationships. [Semicolons are needed, as some list items have
a comma in them.]

The project will go ahead in Tasmania, Queensland and Victoria. [No semicolon is
needed, as each item is a single word.]

The project will go ahead in Rose Bay, Tasmania; West End, Queensland; and
Fitzroy North, Victoria. [Semicolons are needed, as some list items have a comma
in them.]

</example>

## Apostrophes

Apostrophes show possession and contractions. Don’t use them in descriptive
phrases or to make nouns and shortened forms plural.

### An apostrophe shows possession

When the first of 2 consecutive
[nouns](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/nouns)
has an apostrophe, it means those nouns have a relationship. If the first noun
in a [noun
phrase](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/parts-sentences/phrases##noun_phrases_function_as_nouns)
has an apostrophe, it means the noun is related to the other words in the
phrase.

The type of relationship shown by the apostrophe differs, but all are known
collectively as ‘possessives’ and sometimes as ‘genitives’.

On this page, ‘possession’ or ‘possessive’ means any relationship between nouns
– or between words in a noun phrase – that is shown by an apostrophe.

<example>
* This is Ariah’s desk.
* We enjoy Adelaide’s music festivals.
* They are the minister’s chief of staff.
* It was a winter’s morning.</example>

### Follow the possession rules for different types of nouns

To correctly show possession by using an apostrophe, first ask, ‘Who or what is
doing the possessing?’

The apostrophe goes straight after the noun that is the answer.

There are possession rules for using an apostrophe, according to the [type of
noun](/node/122).

Noun possession rulesNoun typeRuleExamplesSingular nounAdd an apostrophe and ‘s’the committee’s reportour department’s planthe bus’s passengersthe kibbutz’s energy needsSingular noun of 2 or more words, the last word being a plural ending in ‘s’Add an apostrophe onlythe Australian Bureau of Statistics’ officea Department of Social Services’ projectthe United States’ representativesPlural nouns that end in letter ‘s’Add an apostrophe onlyboth committees’ reportsthe Joneses’ submissionthe Sanchezes’ security passesPlural nouns that don’t end in ‘s’Add an apostrophe and ‘s’our children’s educationthe sheep’s woolthe gateaux’s boxesProper names ending in letter ‘s’Add an apostrophe and another ‘s’, even if you don’t pronounce that final ‘s’Burns’s reportJames’s professionLaos’s populationLouis’s supervisorJesus’s disciplesMore than one noun: individual possessionAdd an apostrophe and ‘s’ after each nounSmith’s and Miller’s officesMore than one noun: joint possessionAdd an apostrophe and ‘s’ after the last noun onlySmith and Miller’s reportJulie and Karl’s childrenSingular compound nounAdd an apostrophe and ‘s’ after the compoundthe attorney-general’s speechesthe owner-occupier’s accountantPlural compound nouns ending in ‘s’Add an apostrophe after the compoundall owner-occupiers’ tax concessionsPlural compound nouns that don’t end in ‘s’Add an apostrophe and ‘s’ after the compoundthe attorneys-general’s meeting

### A descriptive phrase doesn’t need an apostrophe

Some nouns are descriptive rather than possessive. In a descriptive noun phrase,
the first noun modifies the second noun by operating as a [definitive
adjective](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/adjectives##there_is_a_common_order_for_strings_of_adjectives).

Don’t use an apostrophe for these nouns.

The first noun is essential to the meaning of the second noun. For this reason,
never separate the nouns in a descriptive phrase.

<example>
* workers compensation [A type of insurance]
* visitors book [A type of book]
* drivers licence [A type of licence]</example>

Only add an apostrophe when showing possession.

<example>
* They signed the visitors book. [Descriptive: a type of book]
* Her visitor’s book was lying on the table. [Possessive: the book her visitor owns]
* She attended a directors meeting. [Descriptive: a type of meeting]
* The director’s meetings don’t have an agenda. [Possessive: the meetings of the director]
* You must hold a valid drivers licence to drive on Australian roads. [Descriptive: a type of licence]
* The officer asked to see the driver’s licence. [Possessive: the licence owned by the driver]
* Each state and territory has its own regulator to administer workers compensation. [Descriptive: a type of compensation insurance]
* Under the award, our workers’ compensation for working overtime is time off in lieu. [Possessive: a form of compensation to workers for doing overtime]</example>

In the last 2 examples, the distinction between descriptive and possessive is
subtle.

The Style Manual recognises ‘workers compensation’ in the first example as a
descriptive phrase.

Although not recommended style, we acknowledge that the house styles of some
government agencies require an apostrophe when using the phrase in this way.

### Add an apostrophe and ‘s’ to form a possessive shortened form

There are 4 types of shortened forms:
[abbreviations](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/format-writing-and-structure/clear-language-and-writing-style/plain-language-and-word-choice/abbreviations),
[contractions](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/format-writing-and-structure/clear-language-and-writing-style/plain-language-and-word-choice/contractions),
[acronyms and
initialisms](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/format-writing-and-structure/clear-language-and-writing-style/plain-language-and-word-choice/acronyms-and-initialisms).

Only use shortened forms if users will understand them. Make sure they are
appropriate for your content’s context, purpose and tone.

Add an apostrophe and ‘s’ to show possession for [shortened
forms](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases).

<example>
* Enjoy hassle-free travel with Tassie's new permit system! [Abbreviation]
* The fire destroyed some of ASIO’s files. [Acronym]
* The provisions of the bill are based on the Cth’s Act. [Contraction]
* The review approved ABS’s work plan. [Initialism]</example>

Consider whether the possessive form is necessary or can be replaced by a
descriptive phrase.

<example>
* ASIO files are stored securely.
* Qantas aircraft have an excellent safety record.
* We read several US data use agreements.
* Consultation with stakeholders is integral to ABS work plans.</example>

#### Add ‘s’ to make a plural shortened form – not apostrophe and ‘s’

Add an ‘s’ to form the plural of shortened forms such as [acronyms and
initialisms](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/format-writing-and-structure/clear-language-and-writing-style/plain-language-and-word-choice/acronyms-and-initialisms).
Don’t write an apostrophe before the ‘s’. The same rule applies when [making
nouns
plural](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/nouns##nouns_can_be_singular_or_plural).

<example>
* MPs
* LGAs
* PCs</example>

Add an apostrophe to plural shortened forms to show possession.

<example>
* MPs’ entitlements
* POWs’ repatriation</example>

#### Don’t use a possessive when defining a shortened form

Define a shortened form the first time you use it (unless you’re certain users
will understand it without a definition). Follow the spelt-out term with its
shortened form in parentheses.

Avoid using a possessive apostrophe when you do this. It can be difficult to
decide where to put the apostrophe and the sentence is often harder to read.

Use the shortened form rather than the full term if you mention the term again.

<example>
* The Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) has information about veteran support officers on its website. DVA supports …
* Use the Moneysmart savings goal calculator from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). ASIC created Moneysmart to …</example>

### A possessive pronoun doesn’t need an apostrophe

Don’t add an apostrophe to possessive
[pronouns](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/pronouns).

Although the term ‘possessive pronoun’ is commonly used, it’s more accurate to
divide these pronouns into possessive pronouns and
[determiners](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/determiners)
(also called ‘possessive determiners’).

If a pronoun appears before the noun, it is a determiner. If a pronoun appears
in place of the noun, it is a possessive pronoun.

Don’t use an apostrophe for either type of pronoun.

<example>
* This is your office. That is theirs. [‘your’ is a determiner, ‘theirs’ is a possessive pronoun]
* The fault is ours. [‘ours’ is a possessive pronoun]
* Put the report in its place. [‘its’ is a determiner]
* It was my idea not yours! [‘my’ is a determiner, ‘yours’ is a possessive pronoun]</example>

### Don’t use an apostrophe for an Australian place name

Don’t use an apostrophe for [Australian place
names](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/node/134) involving possessives.

<example>
* Kings Cross
* Mrs Macquaries Chair</example>

### Don’t use an apostrophe for a period of time

Noun phrases about plural time periods don’t need apostrophes because they’re
usually descriptive, not possessive.

In phrases such as ‘6 months retired’ or ‘5 months pregnant’, the time periods
are clearly adjectival. They don’t show possession.

Other noun phrases aren’t possessive because they are conversational shorthand
for an ‘of’ phrase. For example, ‘in 4 days time’ is shorthand for ‘in 4 days of
time’.

Some styles use an apostrophe to stand for the word ‘of’ and don't use it for
descriptive phrases. For many years, the Style Manual has recommended the simple
rule of no apostrophe for either use.

<example>
* 6 weeks time
* 3 months wages</example>

When the time reference is in the singular, use an apostrophe to show that the
noun is singular.

<example>
* a day’s work
* the year’s cycle</example>

### An apostrophe shows a contraction

Apostrophes show that you have omitted letters in
[contractions](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/node/191).

<example>

#### Example

* I haven’t seen the report.
* It’s a busy day at the office.</example>

Don’t confuse ‘it’s’ (the contraction of ‘it is’ or ‘it has’) with ‘its’
(showing that ‘it’ owns something).

If you can divide ‘it’s’ into ‘it is’ or ‘it has’, then you need to use an
apostrophe. ‘Its’ is a determiner and doesn’t have an apostrophe.

<example>

#### Example

* It’s time to give the committee its terms of reference.</example>

### Don’t use an apostrophe to make a noun plural

No apostrophe is needed for the [plural form of a
noun](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/nouns##nouns_can_be_singular_or_plural).
This type of error is known as the ‘greengrocer’s apostrophe’.

<example>

#### Correct

* the 2020s
* committee reports
* newer 747s
* fresh avocados</example>

#### Plural words and phrases that are not usually nouns

Don’t use an apostrophe for nouns and noun phrases formed by pluralising (and
sometimes hyphenating) words that aren’t usually nouns. Two examples are ‘whys
and wherefores’ and ‘what-ifs’.

The Style Manual follows the style for pluralising nouns – no apostrophe. We
also prefer to use the minimal punctuation needed to make meaning clear.

If you’re unsure, check your preferred dictionary. Many popular phrases appear
as entries.

<example>
* The website included a list of dos and don’ts.
* No ifs, ands or buts about it!
* Ums and ahs littered every speech.
* They made their thank-yous then left.</example>

#### Single letter and digit plurals

Use an apostrophe before the ‘s’ for plurals of single letters and single-digit
numbers. They are exceptions to the rule of not using an apostrophe for the
plural form of a noun.

The apostrophe ensures that letter plurals are easier to understand.

Don’t italicise these plurals or place them in quotation marks.

<example>

##### Example

* Binary code uses 0’s and 1’s.
* Dot your i’s and cross your t’s when you edit the report.
* This tongue twister has too many s’s!</example>

### An apostrophe can stand in for a sound

Apostrophes show sounds in words from other languages.

This occurs when words in certain languages are ‘transliterated’, that is, when
words in other languages are written using letters of the English alphabet.

In our examples, the apostrophe is a transliteration of a letter with a
diacritic mark that represents the sound of a glottal stop.

If you’re unsure whether an apostrophe is needed, consult your dictionary for
the preferred spelling.

<example>

#### Example

* She was reading the Qur’an.
* Ge’ez is an ancient language from Ethiopia.</example>

### Some official names have apostrophes

An apostrophe can form part of the official [name of an organisation (or
entity)](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/node/88). Use an apostrophe if the
organisation does.

To find the spelling an organisation prefers, check its correct name by
using [reliable
sources](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/organisation-names##check_the_correct_name_of_an_organisation).

<example>

#### Example

* National Farmers’ Federation
* Australian Workers Union
* Energy Ministers’ Meeting
* Education Ministers Meeting
* Infrastructure and Transport Senior Officials’ Committee
* Basin Officials Committee</example>

## Colons

Colons draw attention to the text that follows. Only add colons that are
essential. Use them to introduce examples, contrasts, lists and block quotes.

### Limit colon use

Use a colon only if you are sure it is needed. Incorrect use creates confusion
for users.

### Introduce examples and contrasts with colons

Use a colon to:

* introduce a word, phrase or clause that provides more detail
* introduce a question
* give an example
* summarise or contrast with what comes before it.

<example> 
* Use correct spelling: check a dictionary if you need to.
* Our work is about answering this simple question: how?
* We’ll have to use a stronger tool: sanctions.
* This is the guiding principle for our workplace: collaboration.
* The committee found there was only one possible explanation: fraud.
</example>

A sentence fragment can come before the colon if the fragment can stand alone or
if it’s introducing a bulleted list.

<example> 
Warning: strong winds forecast for Sydney today.

</example>

### Start lists with a colon

Use a colon to introduce a list of words, phrases or clauses.

<example> 
Pick any 2 of the 3: low price, high speed, high quality.

The position has these requirements: strong communication skills and experience
across content management platforms.

We need to:

* check Appendix A of the report
* ask Mary about the final chapter of her book
* rewrite our introduction.
</example>

Don’t include a colon when the list flows on as part of a full sentence. This is
a common error.

<example> 
#### Correct
Pick any 2 of low price, high speed and high quality.

The requirements for the position are strong communication skills and experience
across content management platforms.

</example>

Include the colon to restructure content into [bulleted lists](/node/56).

<example> 
The requirements for the position are:

* strong communication skills
* experience across content management platforms.
</example>

### Use lower case following a colon in most cases

Start the word after the colon with a lower case letter unless:

* the word that follows the colon is a [proper noun](/node/122##proper_nouns_are_the_names_of_specific_things)
* the text after the colon is a question that is a complete sentence.

<example> 
#### Correct
We had to write 66 reports: it took months.

The commander was confident: Special Air Service Regiment had enough ammunition.

</example>

After a colon, capitalise the first word of questions that are complete
sentences. This makes it clear that the question mark applies only to the text
after the colon.

<example> 
The election was fought on a simple question: Which party had the best economic
credentials?

</example>

If the colon introduces a series of sentences or questions, use a lead-in and
colon to introduce them in a [bulleted or numbered list](/node/56).

<example> 
They answered the question:

* They wrote 23 reports.
* Each report took 11 days to write.
</example>

### Start subtitles of books and articles with a colon

Use a colon before the subtitle of a book or article. Follow the colon with a
lower case letter, unless it’s a proper noun.

<example> 
 

Teaching in Australia: a deep dive into the education system

Stanovich KE (1986) ‘Matthew effects in reading: some consequences of individual
differences in the acquisition of literacy’, Reading Research Quarterly,
21(4):360–407.

</example>

Do this when writing about a book or article and also when [referencing
one](/node/181).

### Introduce block quotes with colons

Use a colon to introduce a block quote. Block quotes should also be coded with
the HTML <blockquote>  element.

<example> 
 

For example, Manthorpe (2019) stated:

Short sentences are easier to read because they limit the scope of an idea. But
most readers like the variety and rhythm of a mixture of sentence lengths. For
most readers, aim for an average sentence length of 15 words per sentence.

</example>

### Write mathematical ratios with a colon

Use a colon to give a [mathematical ratio](/node/145). Don’t put a space after
the colon.

<example> 
 

The government proposes a 50:50 split.

The cost-benefit ratio will be 7.5:1.

</example>

## Commas

Commas separate parts of a sentence so the meaning is clear. Sentence structure
determines their correct use.

### Separate introductory words, phrases and clauses with a comma

A comma separates introductory words, phrases and clauses from the main clause
of the sentence.

Many introductory phrases can be moved to the end of sentences without changing
the meaning. In these cases, you don’t need a comma before the phrase. This
simpler structure can be easier to read.

<example>
* During the meeting, we discussed Item 9.
* We discussed Item 9 during the meeting.</example>

#### Place a comma after adverbs and other introductory words

Use a comma after introductory words, such as greetings and adverbs, or when
addressing someone. Using an introductory word gives it emphasis.

<example>
* Yes, they went to the estimates hearing. [Affirmative emphasis]
* Goodnight, and good luck. [Greeting]
* Actually, that's an interesting point. [Adverb]
* Excuse me, should I come with you? [Addressing someone]</example>

You don’t need a comma after an introductory word if the sentence is very short.
This minimises punctuation in very short sentences.

<example>
Today I went to work.</example>

#### Use a comma after phrases and clauses that change the whole sentence

Use commas after [adverbial phrases](/node/127) and [adverbial
clauses](/node/127). Adverbs – such as ‘first’ and ‘during’ – modify verbs,
adjectives and other adverbs.

<example>
* During the meeting, we discussed item 9. [Adverbial phrase]
* Although they were shaking and sweating, the firefighters were relieved to feel the first drops of a downpour. [Adverbial clause]</example>

Conditional clauses are adverbial clauses (for example, beginning with ‘if’,
‘unless’ or ‘until’). They should also have a comma after them if they start the
sentence.

<example>
Unless the consultation starts early, it will not finish on time. [A conditional
adverbial clause]</example>

#### Avoid beginning a sentence with a string of numbers and dates

Use a comma after an introductory phrase that ends with a numeral and is
immediately followed by another numeral. It doesn’t matter how short the
sentence is.

Avoid this type of sentence structure because the string of numbers can be
confusing.

<example>
There were 16.5 million people enrolled to vote in Australian elections on 18
April 2019.

[This structure avoids stringing a number together with a date.]</example>

### Mark out non‐essential information within a sentence

Commas isolate information in a sentence when it isn’t essential to:

* meaning
* grammatical structure.

Within a sentence, use a pair of commas to separate non-essential or
supplementary information. Always check for the second comma where there should
be a pair.

Generally, if you can take out part of the sentence and it is still
grammatically correct, it should be between a pair of commas.

Check carefully. Using comma pairs can completely change the meaning of a
sentence.

<example>
The committee, said the secretary, was incompetent. [The committee was
incompetent.]

The committee said the secretary was incompetent. [The secretary was
incompetent.]</example>

Elements that function as supplementary information include:

* non-essential clauses
* nouns that define the same thing
* question tags.

#### Set off non-essential clauses

Use commas around clauses that add information but aren’t essential to the
meaning of the sentence.

Don’t use commas if the clause is essential for meaning.

If you can remove the clause and your sentence means the same thing, it’s
non-essential and should go between commas.

Non-essential clauses are also called ‘non-restrictive’ or
‘non-defining’ [clauses](/node/143).

<example>

###### Non-essential

The business report, which the manager had edited, explained the agency’s
strategy.

[The main message is ‘The business report explained the agency’s strategy’. The
clause ‘which the manager had edited’ gives more information, adding to the
meaning. It doesn’t change the meaning.]

Introduced pests, such as varroa mite, threaten Australian honey production.

[All introduced pests threaten honey production. The varroa mite is just an
example.]

###### Essential

The report that the manager had edited explained the agency’s strategy.

[The clause ‘that the manager had edited’ is essential to the meaning because
there is no other information in the sentence to identify what report is being
referred to.]

Introduced pests from South Asia threaten Australian honey production.

[Only pests from South Asia threaten honey production. Other introduced pests
don’t affect honey production.]</example>

Each of these examples separates a [grammatical subject from its
verb](/node/120##a_full_sentence_is_a_complete_idea). This is a problem when the
subject is overburdened with non-essential information.

Check if you can rephrase the information to make it easier to follow. It is
easier for people to read shorter sentences.

<example>
The report was tabled last week. It is about demographic changes in rural areas
in Western Australia.</example>

#### Place commas around nouns that define the same thing they follow

Use a pair of commas when you have 2 noun phrases next to each other that define
the same thing.

<example>

##### Correct

The strike took place in Whyalla, South Australia, in June 2014.

[The noun phrase ‘South Australia’ is between 2 commas because it is
non-essential information. ‘South Australia’ adds to the meaning but doesn’t
change the meaning.]</example>

You should be able to take out the noun phrase between the comma pair and still
have a grammatically correct sentence.

<example>
* My colleague, Mx Lesley May, will exercise my proxy vote.
* My colleague will exercise my proxy vote.</example>

The sentence loses detail without the second noun phrase (Mx Lesley May), but it
is still a full sentence.

#### Separate questions tagged onto a sentence

Questions can be tagged onto the end of sentences. Use a comma before a question
that is part of the sentence.

<example>
* They’re not here, are they?
* We’ll be reporting back, won’t we?</example>

#### Use commas with the phrase ‘for example’

Generally, use a comma before and after the phrase ‘for example’ in a sentence.

<example>
Some colours, for example, are difficult for people with colour blindness to
distinguish.</example>

If ‘for example’ begins a sentence, it is an [introductory phrase](/node/144).
Follow it with a comma.

<example>

##### Example

For example, some colours are difficult for people with colour blindness to
distinguish.
</example>

If you’re introducing a bullet list after ‘for example’, use a colon.

<example>

##### Example

Some colours are difficult for people with colour blindness to distinguish, for
example:

* red
* green
* orange
* brown
* blue
* purple.</example>

#### Don’t use commas with Latin shortened forms

If you use [Latin shortened forms](/node/91), such as ‘e.g.’ and ‘i.e.’, don’t
follow them with a comma.

<example>

##### Correct

Exports of rare earths (e.g. lithium, europium) have soared.
</example>

### Place commas between principal clauses joined together with a conjunction

Use commas to connect 2 or more [principal
clauses](/node/143##a_principal_clause_can_stand_alone_as_a_sentence) joined by a
[coordinating
conjunction](/node/129##coordinating_conjunctions_join_things_of_equal_importance)
(‘and’, ‘or’, ‘but’, ‘so’).

If they have different subjects, use a comma before the coordinating
conjunction.

Do not use this rule to create a sentence of more than 25 words. Shorter
sentences are easier to read.

<example>

#### Example

The Senate debated the Bill at length, but the party whips eventually called for
a vote.

[‘But’ is the coordinating conjunction. ‘The Senate’ and ‘the party whips’ are
each the subjects of a principal clause.]
</example>

If 2 clauses share the same subject, you don’t need to repeat the subject or
insert a comma before the conjunction.

<example>

#### Example

The company closed its Perth office and sacked the chief financial officer.

[‘The company’ closed an office and sacked an executive officer. ‘The
company’ is the subject of both clauses, joined using ‘and’.]
</example>

The exception to this rule is when you have joined more than 2 principal clauses
with the same subject.

<example>

#### Example

The company closed its Perth office, sacked the chief financial officer, and
opened a branch in Singapore.

[The verbs ‘closed’, ‘sacked’ and ‘opened’ each complement the same subject:
‘the company’. Each complement completes a principal clause.]
</example>

#### Don’t use commas to ‘splice’ sentences

Don’t use a comma to link 2 stand-alone sentences unless you use a coordinating
conjunction. This kind of error is called a ‘comma splice’.

<example>
##### Correct

The report was finished last week, but the minister has not approved its
release.
</example>

### Punctuate sentence lists and strings of adjectives

#### Separate items in lists of nouns or adjectives with commas

Use commas between items in a sentence list. Avoid using a comma before the last
item in the list.

This rule applies to sentence lists and sentence fragments in bullet lists. Do
not punctuate the end of a list item with a comma if it is in a bullet list.

<example>
##### Example

* The delegation visited Brisbane, Canberra and Adelaide.
* The consultation involved businesses, sole traders and not-for-profits.
* The applicant was willing to learn, eager to work and well prepared.</example>

#### Restrict the use of the Oxford comma

If the last item combines 2 words or phrases with the word ‘and’, use a comma
before that final item. This use of the comma is known as the ‘Oxford comma’ or
‘serial comma’.

<example>
##### Example

The industries most affected are retail trade, wholesale trade, and
accommodation and food services.

[‘Accommodation and food services’ is listed as a single industry category. It
is set off in the list with an Oxford comma.]
</example>

The Oxford comma can prevent ambiguity in complex sentence lists. For example,
use the Oxford comma before the last item if you’re using a defining phrase
applicable only to that final item.

A defining phrase is essential to the meaning of the sentence. The following
examples show how the Oxford comma can affect meaning, using the defining phrase
‘for stockfeed’.

<example>
##### Example

The analysis outlined demand for barley, wheat and hay for stockfeed. [All crops
are for stockfeed.]

The analysis outlined demand for barley, wheat, and hay for stockfeed. [Only the
hay is for stockfeed.]
</example>

#### Separate adjectives of the same type

When writing strings of adjectives, use a set order – [evaluative, descriptive,
then definitive](/node/126##strings_of_adjectives_have_a_naturalsounding_order).

Use commas in strings of adjectives of the same type (for example, a string of
descriptive adjectives).

<example>
##### Example

* This is an ethical, profitable, efficient organisation. [Descriptive adjectives]
* They were a happy, caring, devoted workforce. [Evaluative adjectives]</example>

Don’t use commas in strings of adjectives of different types.

<example>
##### Example

* My new black felt-tip pen splattered ink everywhere.
* We found some used French tennis balls left over from a training day.</example>

### Use commas in numbers with 4 or more digits

Numbers with 4 or more digits (starting from 1,000) need a comma. Use commas for
numerals in text and in tables.

Don’t use a space between the digits, because screen readers can read them as
separate numbers.

<example>
#### Correct

The agency handles around 6,500 complaints each year.
</example>

When you are using numbers of 1,000 or more, use commas to separate the numerals
into groups of 3 (working right to left).

<example>
#### Example

* 1,000
* 17,275
* 505,607,400</example>

Commas are not used to the right of a decimal point.

<example>
#### Example

* 808.12345
* 1,279.0044</example>

Don’t use commas in postcodes or [dates](/node/140).

<example>
#### Example

* The year was 2020.
* The office was in postcode area 6500.</example>

#### Use numerals and words for large, rounded numbers

Numbers below a million are usually easy to read as numerals. Use a combination
of words and numerals for [large, rounded numbers from a
million](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words##combine_numerals_and_words_for_large_rounded_numbers).

Large, rounded numbers are punctuated with a [decimal point](/node/146).

<example>
##### Example

* There are close to 4 million houses with rooftop solar.
* This budget year will see a surplus of $7.1 billion, equal to 0.4 per cent of GDP.</example>

You can use ‘1’ or ‘one’ when writing a million, a billion and so on. Both forms
are acceptable in government content.

Choosing which style to use depends on the [context and the type of
content](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words##use_1_million_and_one_million_in_certain_contexts).

<example>
##### Example

* The video ad garnered 3.2 million views on TikTok and 1 million views on Snapchat.
* The university’s endowments total more than one billion dollars.</example>

### Show direct speech or quoted material using commas

Introduce directly quoted speech with a comma. Use the comma in combination with
quotation marks.

<example>
#### Example

* She said, ‘It’s time to start work.’
* The Prime Minister said, ‘I’m calling a half-Senate election.’</example>

If an attribution comes after a quotation, use a comma at the end of the
quotation and before the [quotation mark](/node/114).

<example>
#### Example

* ‘It’s time to start work,’ she said.
* ‘I’m calling a half-Senate election for Saturday 15 August,’ the Prime Minister said.</example>

If the quotation is broken into 2 parts, the second part should follow a full
stop rather than a comma.

<example>
#### Example

* ‘It’s time to start work,’ she said. ‘We have a lot to do.’
* ‘I’m calling a half-Senate election,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘It will be held on Saturday 15 August.’</example>

If the quotation ends the sentence, end it with the original punctuation of the
quotation.

<example>
#### Example

* She said, ‘It’s time to start work.’
* She asked, ‘Is it time to start work?’</example>

## Dashes

Dashes show a relationship. Generally, en dashes for spans are less accessible
for users than a phrase. Use spaced en dashes to set off non-essential
information in sentences.

### Use the correct symbols for en dash and minus sign

En dashes are half the width of the font height. Use them as a type of
punctuation.

Don’t use an en dash instead of a minus sign. Screen readers will read dashes as
dashes, not as the minus sign.

In Unicode, the en dash is U+2013.

To make sure screen readers read the minus sign, use the mathematical symbol for
minus. In Unicode, this is U+2212.

Don’t confuse the dash or the minus symbol for a [hyphen](/node/105).

### Use a phrase instead of an en dash for most spans of numbers

En dashes show a span when used with numerals, such as in a financial year, a
range of values or span of time. En dashes sometimes appear in a span of words,
such as in a span of days of the week.

Avoid using an en dash in most content.

Dashes can affect readability unless a user changes their screen reader’s
default settings (punctuation verbosity settings). Screen readers generally
won’t read out dashes by default. This can affect people’s ability to quickly
understand spans.

That is why, in general content, it’s better to use phrases for most spans of
numbers. You can use en dashes in technical content, particularly if it contains
a lot of spans.

#### Spans in general content

Avoid using en dashes for spans in body text and headings. Instead, use the
phrases:

* ‘from’ paired with ‘to’ – for example, ‘from 57 to 65 years’
* ‘between’ paired with ‘and’ – for example, ‘between Monday and Friday’.

Never mix ‘from’ or ‘between’ with an en dash.

<example>

##### Correct

* She worked from 10 to 28 January.
* All seminars run from 10:30 am to 11:30 am.
* Annual rainfall between 2017 and 2019 was lower than the long-term average.
* The help desk operates between 9 am and 4 pm daily.</example>

### Follow exceptions to the general rule

There are exceptions to the rule of using phrases for spans in general content.
The exceptions are for particular date spans and time spans.

Use an en dash for date spans in:

* financial years
* calendar years
* the titles of publications and programs
* citations containing a title that has an en dash
* terms of office
* lifespans (birth and death)
* when there is limited space.

Date spans in titles and headings should follow the general rule, except when:

* the heading contains a title that has an en dash
* using words would push the character count over 70 characters (including spaces).

Only use an en dash for time spans when you have limited space.

Date spans in titles and headings should follow the general rule, except when:

* phrases would push the character count over 70 characters (including spaces)
* the dash is part of an existing heading or title that you are citing as a reference.

#### Use an en dash for financial years

For financial years, use 4 digits for the first number and only 2 digits for the
second. Join them with an unspaced en dash. This will not create any issue for
users who rely on screen readers.

Use the phrases ‘financial year’ and ‘financial years’ at first mention, unless
the context makes the meaning clear.

<example>
* The 2019–20 budget [The financial year starting in July 2019 and finishing in June 2020]
* The department recently published a list of gifts received by officials during the 2022–23 financial year. A list of gifts received during 2023–24 will be published in September 2024.</example>

For financial years that cross centuries, use 4 digits on either side of the
en dash.

<example>
* The 1999–2000 budget [The financial year starting in July 1999 and finishing in June 2000]
* The department recently published a list of gifts received by officials during the 1999–2000 financial year. A list of gifts received during 2001–02 will be published in September 2002.</example>

#### Use an en dash for calendar years

For calendar years, use 4 digits for the first number and either 4 or 2 digits
for the second number. Join them with an unspaced en dash.

Use the phrases ‘calendar year’ and ‘calendar years’ at first mention, unless
the context makes the meaning clear.

<example>
* We provide indicative statistics at the halfway point of each 4-yearly reporting cycle. The following indicative statistics cover the 2023–24 calendar years. You can find indicative statistics for 2021–22 on our website.</example>

#### Use an en dash for date spans in titles of publications and programs

Date spans often appear in the titles of government publications and programs.
When you create a title, use 4 digits for the first year and 2 digits for the
second year. If you cross the century, always use 4 digits for both years.

Use 4 digits on both sides of the span for these titles if that is your
organisation’s house style.

When you refer to an existing title, follow the style that was originally used
for year spans.

<example>
* The diversity strategy 2020–25
* The Lake Eyre basin plan 1999–2004
* The state government has opened the 2023–24 Skilled Migration Visa Nomination Program.
* They found the statistics in The year book of international trade 1922–23.
* ‘Headway’ is my favourite poem from the collection titled Tryptych: selected poems 1956–1962.
* The Milk for school children scheme 1951–74 provided free milk to Australian primary schools.
* You can find more about milestones in our Wellbeing Action Plan 2005–2008.</example>

Reproduce titles with dashes when you cite them as a reference.

<example>
* 1Department of Business Measures (DBM), ‘Business statistics 1990–91’, Australian Business Series 5, DBM, Australian Government, 1991. [Footnote or endnote]</example>

#### Use an en dash for terms of office

A person’s term of office usually appears in parentheses after the person’s
name. Always use 4 digits for both dates, joined by an unspaced en dash.

<example>
Australia’s prime minister at the start of the Depression was James Scullin
(1929–1932).</example>

#### Use an en dash for a person’s lifespan

Dates of birth and death usually appear in parentheses after the person’s name.
Always use 4 digits for both dates, joined by an unspaced en dash.

<example>
Caroline Chisholm (1808–1877)</example>

#### Use an en dash for date spans when space is limited

Follow the general rule and use words for date spans unless you have limited
space. This could be in display text, tables, lists or in social media posts.

Use the following style for en dashes in spans of days and months:

* The en dash is spaced when the day and month appear on both sides of the span.
* The en dash is unspaced when the month appears only at the end of the span.

<example>
  </example>

#### Restrict the use of en dashes for date spans in headings

Only use en dashes for date spans in headings when:

* your heading includes a title that contains en dashes
* using words pushes the character count above 70 characters (including spaces).

In all other cases, write date spans in headings with words. Use the phrases
‘from … to’ and ‘between … and’.

<example>
* Publication of the International engagement strategy 2023–26 [Heading in a document. The heading contains a publication title.]
* Background to the Strategic plan 2021–23 [Heading contains a publication title]
* Human trafficking and slavery in Australia from 2015 to 2019 [Heading with ‘from … to’; 60 characters with spaces]
* Overview of human trafficking and slavery in Australia 2015–2019 [Heading with en dash; 64 characters with spaces, but 71 characters if had used ‘from … to’]</example>

#### Only use an en dash for time spans when space is limited

Follow the general rule and use words for time spans unless you only have
limited space. This could be in display text, tables, lists or in social media
posts.

The spacing of the en dash depends on the position of elements in the span.

Use a spaced en dash when:

* ‘am’ or ‘pm’ appears on both sides of the span
* the time is in the 24-hour clock format.

Use an unspaced en dash when:

* the ‘am’ or ‘pm’ appears only at the end of the span
* ‘noon’, ‘midday’ or ‘midnight’ appears in the span.

<example>
* **Free events this month**Good work design in practiceMonday 4 April 1.30–2.30 pmOur changing demographics: policy implicationsThursday 18 April 11:15 am – 12 midday##OurAPS ##apsacademy ##AustralianGovernment</example>

### Use an en dash for spans in technical content

In technical content where there are many numbers, you can use en dashes for
number, date and page spans. Don’t combine en dashes with ‘from’ or ‘to’ in the
spans.

Don’t use spaces either side of these en dashes if they include a numeral on
each side.

<example>
* There were 25–30 head of cattle in quarantine in June and 50–60 in July. [Number span]
* Air quality declined during the 2003–2006 reporting period. [Date span]
* This same result was reported in Smith and Jones (2020:5–15). [Page span]</example>

### Join nouns with en dashes to show equal relationships

Use en dashes between 2 nouns that both retain their original meaning. These are
called ‘coordinate nouns’.

When describing something, coordinate nouns can function as
[adjectives](/node/126).

<example>
* The Murray–Darling Basin [The Murray River and the Darling River combine to form the basin river system.]
* A Sydney–Melbourne flight [Sydney and Melbourne combine to form a single travel route.]</example>

If you used a hyphen instead, you create a compound noun. These cannot stand in
for coordinate nouns.

<example>

#### Example

* student-teacher [A compound noun, meaning a teacher who is also a student, uses a hyphen.]
* student–teacher ratio [A coordinate noun, describing the ratio of students to teachers, uses an en dash.]</example>

If one part of a coordinate noun is made up of more than one word, use a space
either side of the en dash. Otherwise, do not include spaces around en dashes
for coordinate nouns.

<example>

#### Example

Australia ­– New Zealand relations [The relationship is between Australia and
New Zealand, not ‘Australia’ and ‘New’.]</example>

### Rewrite to avoid joining prefixes with an en dash

A hyphen normally attaches a prefix to an adjectival phrase. An en dash is
correct in some cases, not a hyphen.

If the phrase is not hyphenated, such as in a proper adjectival phrase, you can
use an en dash between the prefix and the first word.

The capitalisation of the proper adjectival phrase and the en dash show that the
prefix applies to all the words.

<example>

#### Example

pre–Cold War policies</example>

In these cases, if you can, reword the phrase so that it doesn’t include the
prefix.

<example>

#### Example

policies from before the Cold War</example>

### Space en dashes in sentences to set off non-essential information

Spaced en dashes create a pause in a sentence to add extra meaning, similar to
commas and brackets.

Use them rarely to use them effectively – for example, to draw attention to a
new and important detail for your main idea. As a rule, [don’t make your
sentences complex or long](/node/204).

#### En dashes inside a sentence

Spaced en dashes draw attention because they aren’t as common as other
punctuation marks. They help some people scan content by showing that
information is non-essential or parenthetical.

Spaced en dashes can separate a clarification, an interruption, a correction, a
short list or a summary from the rest of the text.

Always space punctuating en dashes with a single space on either side of the
dash. Spaces allow automatic line breaks in front of or after the dash.

Often, you need a pair of en dashes.

<example>

##### Example

Three rivers – the Murray, Darling and Murrumbidgee – were discussed in the
report.</example>

If the parenthetical information is at the beginning or end of the sentence, you
can use one dash.

<example>

##### Example

There was no time to plan – a shortcoming that would later cost millions.</example>

Make sure the rest of the sentence makes sense.

If you remove the content between the en dashes, the rest of the sentence must
be a complete sentence.

<example>

##### Example

* The allies – the USA, Australia and New Zealand – signed the pact in 1951.
* The allies signed the pact in 1951.</example>

In a sentence with one en dash, one side of the dash must be a complete
sentence.

<example>
Solar, wind, hydro and tidal power – all are viable options for renewable
energy. [‘All are viable options for renewable energy’ is a complete sentence.]</example>

#### Em dashes

Em dashes are the same width as the font height.

Various style guides treat dashes differently. Some styles use unspaced em
dashes instead of spaced en dashes.

Both dashes are grammatically correct and can be used to show:

* additional, amplifying and parenthetical material
* an abrupt change.

Never use both types of dashes for the same purpose.

Spaced en dashes are Australian government style and should be used in digital
content.

Follow this style convention unless a different style reference applies. For
example, you might submit a journal article and need to follow the publisher's
style, which uses unspaced em dashes. Follow one style: apply it throughout.

In Unicode, the em dash is U+2014.

If you are using em dashes in your content, don’t space them. The spaced em dash
creates too great a gap in text. This is a typographical concern and interrupts
reading flow.

An unspaced em dash won’t automatically break over a line. This will mean you
need to force a line break on either side of the dash. It can either end or
begin a line of text.

### Use 2 em dashes for some quoted speech and deliberate omissions in text

To show a sudden interruption in quotations and reported speech, use 2 em dashes
in a row. The 2 em dashes follow a space.

Ellipses cannot be used for this purpose, as they show the writer has
deliberately left out quoted speech. Read related guidance on
[ellipses](/node/115).

<example>
#### Example

‘Any more questions before ——’ [The double em dashes show an interruption in a
quotation.]
</example>

Two em dashes also show when a name or other information is omitted in body text
in general content. This can be useful when something needs to be withheld for
privacy or other legal reasons, for example.

Use a space if the em dashes replace a whole word, but don’t include a space
between the dashes and part of the word.

<example>
#### Example

The deed, signed by ——, was legally binding.

S—— signed the deed in 2017.
</example>

## Forward slashes

Forward slashes are useful in a small number of situations. Users are familiar
with them in mathematical expressions, dates, web addresses and in some
shortened forms.

### Limit the forward slash to specific uses

The forward slash is also known as the ‘solidus’ or just the ‘slash’.

Use forward slashes:

* in some shortened forms
* in mathematical expressions
* to present lines of poetry in body text
* instead of ‘per’, ‘an’ or ‘a’ when abbreviating units of measurement
* in web addresses
* in dates if you can’t write them out – for example, in tables
* in some place names.

<example>
* c/- [for ‘care of’ in postal addresses]
* n/a [for ‘not applicable’]
* (x + y)/(a + b)
* http://www.abc.net.au/foreign
* 04/12/2020</example>

### Don’t add spaces around most forward slashes

There is no need to include a space on either side of a forward slash.

The exceptions are for:

* [official dual place names](/node/134##check_official_place_names_and_style_them_correctly)
* lines of poetry in body text – use forward slashes with spaces around them to show the line breaks.

<example>
truwana / Cape Barren Island [Official dual place name]</example>

#### Print considerations

As far as possible, avoid using forward slashes either side of a line break.

If you must, include the slash before the line break so that the reader
anticipates it as they read the next line.

### Write shortened units of measurement with a forward slash

Don’t use forward slashes when spelling out [units of measurement](/node/147).

<example>

#### Correct

* 60 km/h
* 60 kilometres per hour</example>

### Use an en dash for financial years, not a slash

Don’t use a forward slash as a replacement for an en dash in financial years.

<example>

#### Correct

2019–20</example>

### Write ‘or’ instead of a slash for alternatives

When showing alternatives, use ‘or’ instead of a forward slash. This is easier
for people to understand.

<example>
a yes or no question</example>

Do not use ‘and/or’ in text. It could mean either ‘and’ or ‘or’, which confuses
many users. Rewrite the sentence to make the meaning clear.

### Don’t join words with a slash

Don’t use a forward slash between words that retain their separate identities.
Instead, either use an en dash or reword the sentence. Forward slashes can make
it look like you mean to show an alternative.

<example>
* a Sydney–Brisbane flight
* a Sydney to Brisbane flight</example>

## Hyphens

Hyphens connect words and prefixes so meaning is clear. Refer to your
organisation’s preferred dictionary when you are not sure if you need to use a
hyphen for spelling.

### Follow hyphenation rules in the dictionary your organisation uses

Hyphens clarify meaning by connecting words and parts of words into a single
unit of meaning. Use hyphens to avoid ambiguity.

<example>
* ‘a little used office’, but ‘a little-used office’
* ‘a unionised workforce’, but ‘an un-ionised particle’</example>

There are few firm rules about using hyphens, and dictionaries do not always
agree.

Use the dictionary your organisation recommends and follow its hyphenation
practices.

Follow the accepted naming conventions for [compass points](/node/135), [names
of people](/node/90) and [names of places](/node/134).

#### Print considerations

Don’t break short words over a line, especially:

* words of fewer than 6 letters
* one-syllable words
* 2-syllable words.

Break words between syllables so that the hyphen:

* is between 2 components of a compound word (for example, ‘data-base’)
* is between the base word and the suffix or prefix (for example, ‘neat-ness’)
* comes before a consonant (for example, write ‘fic-tion’ not ‘fict-ion’) unless this is misleading (for example, write ‘draw-ings’ not ‘dra-wings’).

Don’t include extra hyphens if you need to break up URLs or email addresses.
People could read them as part of the address.

Use the part of the word before the hyphen to suggest the rest of the word.
Consider the vowels and consonants when breaking words over a line.

### Write certain prefixes with a hyphen

Hyphens are useful in some sets of words formed with prefixes such as:

* ‘anti-’
* ‘auto-’
* ‘counter-’
* ‘extra-’
* ‘intra-’
* ‘re-’
* ‘sub-’.

They’re especially useful for:

* doubled-up vowels
* clarifying new words that could be confused with existing ones.

A hyphen is used in some words with prefixes to distinguish them from words that
would otherwise look the same.

<example>
* ‘re-cover‘ [cover again], but ‘recover‘ [retrieve or regain]
* ‘re-creation‘ [create anew], but ‘recreation‘ [leisure-related activity]
* ‘re-signed‘ [signed again], but ‘resigned‘ [stepped down or acquiescent]</example>

Sometimes a prefix such as ‘non-’, ‘pre-’ or ‘anti-’ acts on more than one word.
If the phrase is already hyphenated, use a second hyphen to link the prefix to
all words in the phrase.

<example>
* non-English-speaking countries
* an anti-harm-minimisation stance</example>

#### Doubled-up vowels

Use a hyphen when the last letter of a single-syllable prefix is a vowel and the
word that follows begins with the same vowel.

<example>
* de-emphasise
* pre-eminent
* re-enter</example>

This practice is less important if a word is well known. Check a dictionary if
you are unsure.

<example>
* coordinate
* cooperate</example>

#### Double letters

Hyphens link a prefix or suffix to a word to avoid a double letter or prevent a
misunderstanding.

<example>
* ‘multi-item’, but ‘multilateral’
* ‘re-sign’ [sign again], but ‘resign’ [leave a job]</example>

#### Capital letters

Hyphens link a prefix to a word that starts with a capital letter.

<example>
* un-Australian activities
* pro-European</example>

#### Vowel combinations

Don’t use hyphens if the 2 words end and start with different vowels. The
combined word doesn’t place the same vowel together.

<example>
* prearrange
* reallocate
* triennial</example>

Use a hyphen, however, if the prefix is attached to a single-syllable word
beginning with a vowel. This punctuation means the vowels aren’t read as one
sound.

<example>
de-ice</example>

Two-syllable prefixes ending in a vowel other than ‘o’ and followed by another
vowel are often hyphenated. If the base word begins with a consonant, the term
is usually written as one word.

<example>
* anti-aircraft, antisocial
* semi-official, semicircular</example>

Two-syllable prefixes ending in ‘o’ are often attached without a hyphen,
regardless of what the base word starts with.

<example>
* macroeconomics, macrobiotic
* monoamine, monocultural
* radioactive, radiotherapy
* retroactive, retrograde</example>

#### Consonants

Two-syllable prefixes ending in a consonant are rarely followed by a hyphen.

<example>
* hyperlink, hyperrealism
* interactive, interrelated</example>

#### ‘Co-’ and ‘ex-’ prefixes

Regardless of whether the rest of the word starts with a vowel:

* Many words with the prefix ‘co-’, meaning ‘joint’, have hyphens after the ‘co’.
* All words formed with ‘ex-’, meaning ‘former’, are hyphenated.

<example>

##### Example

* co-author, co-worker
* ex-councillor, ex-president</example>

Follow the spelling in your preferred dictionary.

#### Numbers and italics with prefixes

Use a hyphen if a prefix is followed by a number or an expression that’s in
italics.

<example>

##### Example

* post-1960
* the PNG Government’s anti-raskol measures</example>

### Write most suffixes without hyphens

Suffixes are normally attached directly to the base word without any hyphen. The
commonest suffixes include:

* -able
* -ate
* -ation
* -fold
* -ful
* -ise
* -ish
* -ly
* -ment
* -ness
* -y.

<example>

#### Example

readable

colourful

costly</example>

A hyphen precedes ‘-fold’ when that suffix is used with a numeral, but not a
spelled out number.

<example>

#### Example

* 300-fold
* threefold</example>

Always use a hyphen with the suffix ‘-odd’, whether it’s with a word or numeral.

<example>

#### Example

There were 150-odd competitors.</example>

### Hyphenate some but not all compound words

A compound word consists of 2 or more words that carry a new meaning when used
together.

Hyphens link elements of compound words as a phrase, but usually only when they
are used before a noun as [adjectives](/node/126). Don’t use hyphens when the
phrase is after the noun in the [sentence structure](/node/204).

<example>

#### Example

* ‘the up-to-date accounts’, but ‘the accounts are up to date’
* ‘small-business owners’, but ‘owners of small businesses’
* ‘an 11-year-old child, but ‘a child who is 11 years old’</example>

Don’t confuse hyphens with [dashes](/node/199).

#### Compound nouns

Compound nouns make up the largest group of compound words. They can be made up
of:

* a verb and an adverb
* a verb and a noun
* a noun and a noun
* an adjective and a noun.

Most compound nouns don’t need hyphens because people already understand what
the words mean together.

##### Verb and adverb combinations

Use a hyphen in compound nouns made up of a verb plus an adverb. This shows that
the adverb is part of the compound rather than modifying other elements of the
sentence.

<example>

###### Example

* a shake-out
* some make-up
* the go-ahead for the project</example>

For adverb–verb combinations, you don’t need a hyphen.

<example>

###### Example

* bypass
* downpour
* uproar
* input</example>

##### Verb and noun combinations

Only a few compound nouns made up of a verb and a noun need hyphens. The
following table has some examples, but use a dictionary if you are not sure.

Hyphenation rules for compound nouns made up of a verb and nounVerb and noun combinationHyphenationExampleVerb with no suffix and noun (in either order)one word, no hyphenstingray, roadblockVerb ending in ‘-ing’ or ‘-ed’ and noun2 words, no hyphenflying doctor, shredded paperSingle-syllable noun and verb ending in ‘-ing’ or ‘-ed’one word, no hyphenstocktaking, bookmarkedMulti-syllable noun and verb ending in ‘-ing’ or ‘-ed’[\*](##tnote)Use a hyphen or use 2 separate words (check a dictionary)profit-taking, potato growing\* The endings ‘-ing’ or ‘-ed’ show when the verb happened. Verbs with these endings are called ‘inflected verbs’. In this example, the verb ‘fly’ becomes ‘flying’, ‘shred’ becomes ‘shredded’.
##### Noun-plus-noun combinations

Use of hyphens in noun-plus-noun compounds varies, even from dictionary to
dictionary. These types usually have hyphens:

* expressions in which each element has equal status, which describe one thing
* expressions in which the elements rhyme
* noun compounds involving prepositional phrases.

<example>
###### Example

* owner-driver, city-state
* hocus-pocus
* editor-at-large, mother-in-law</example>

##### Adjective plus noun combination

Compound nouns consisting of an adjective followed by a noun are usually written
as 2 words.

<example>
###### Example

* red tape
* free will</example>

#### Compound adjectives

Compound adjectives need hyphens if they are made up of either:

* 2 adjectives
* a noun and an adjective.

<example>
##### Example

* bitter-sweet, icy-cold, red-hot [Two adjectives]
* accident-prone, colour-blind, disease-free [Noun plus adjective]</example>

It doesn’t matter whether the compound adjective comes before or after the noun
it’s describing.

Hyphenate adjectival compounds made up of adverbial phrases when they come
before the nouns, but not after.

<example>
##### Example

It was a dusk-to-dawn curfew. [The curfew lasted from dusk to dawn.]</example>

Don’t hyphenate adverbial phrases when they play an adverbial role.

<example>
##### Example

* a newly discovered plant species
* a happily married couple</example>

Never use a hyphen for a compound modified by words such as ‘very’,
‘particularly’, ‘least’ or ‘most’.

<example>
##### Example

* a very well known diplomat
* a better known
* a particularly diligent team member
* the most advanced students</example>

Sometimes, you might need to use a hyphen for clarification.

<example>
##### Example

The parents lobbied for more experienced staff. [Parents were asking for more
staff who were also experienced.]

The parents lobbied for more-experienced staff. [Parents were asking for staff
who were more experienced to replace the less experienced staff.]</example>

##### Set phrases

Compound adjectives that are set phrases consisting of a noun plus a noun or an
adjective plus a noun are not usually hyphenated.

<example>
###### Example

* a tax office ruling
* the stock exchange report
* an equal opportunity employer</example>

If the phrase is further modified, use a hyphen to prevent ambiguity.

<example>
###### Example

* a retrospective tax-office ruling
* the Tokyo stock-exchange report
* a renowned equal-opportunity employer</example>

##### Adjectives with verbs

Compound adjectives with present or past participles usually have a hyphen. Some
of these well-established compounds are single words. They will be listed in a
dictionary.

<example>
###### Example

* a government-owned facility
* a heart-rending image
* airborne
* everlasting
* widespread</example>

Hyphenate compound adjectives consisting of a participle or an adjective.

<example>
###### Example

* a well-known book
* a fast-flowing river</example>

Don’t hyphenate a compound adjective made up of an adverb–verb combination if
the adverb ends in ‘-ly’.

<example>
###### Example

* an elegantly executed manoeuvre
* a finely honed argument</example>

##### Numbers and fractions

Use hyphens for compound adjectives involving [numerals, spelt-out
numbers](/node/198) and [ordinal numbers](/node/162).

<example>
###### Example

* a 4-part series
* a 21-gun salute
* a third-storey office</example>

If you need to write out numbers as words rather than numerals, use hyphens to
link numbers from 21 to 99.

<example>
###### Example

* twenty-one
* two hundred and thirty-four
* ninety-nine</example>

Hyphens link parts of a [fraction](/node/146).

<example>
###### Example

* ‘one-half’, but ‘a half’
* ‘one-quarter’, but ‘a quarter’</example>

##### Capitals, italics and quotation marks

Compound adjectives containing capital letters, italics or quotation marks are
not usually hyphenated.

<example>
###### Example

* a High Court decision
* an in situ inspection
* a ‘do or die’ attitude</example>

#### Compound verbs

Hyphenate compound verbs made up of an adjective plus a noun or a noun plus a
verb.

<example>
##### Example

* to cold-shoulder
* to gift-wrap</example>

Don’t hyphenate compound verbs made up of an adverb plus a verb. Write them as
one word.

<example>
##### Example

* to bypass
* to overreact
* to undergo</example>

#### Compound adverbs

Write compound adverbs as one word.

<example>
##### Example

* barefoot
* downstream
* overboard</example>

### Repeat words instead of using a hanging hyphen

Hanging (or floating) hyphens connect 2 words to a base word or a number that
they share.

<example>
#### Example

* 3- or 4-part harmony
* pre- or post-1945
* full- and part-time positions</example>

This can be difficult to follow, so it's clearer to repeat the words.

<example>
#### Example

full-time and part-time positions</example>

### Don’t hyphenate ‘-ing’ and ‘-ed’ verbs or most ‘-ly’ adverbs

Don’t use a hyphen in most compounds consisting of an [adverb](/node/127) ending
in ‘-ly’ and a participle (a part of a [verb](/node/128) ending in ‘-ing’ or
‘-ed’).

<example>
#### Correct

* a fully loaded truck
* his rapidly declining health
* a partly read book</example>

The only exceptions are 2 formations using the adverb ‘fully’:

* ‘fully-fashioned’
* ‘fully-fledged’.

## Punctuation and capitalisation

Punctuation and capitalisation have rules for correct use. Use minimal
punctuation and capitalisation to make content more readable.

### Use minimal punctuation to make meaning clear

Minimal punctuation doesn’t mean removing all punctuation marks from a sentence.
It means removing unnecessary punctuation.

Only use punctuation that makes the sentence grammatically correct and the
meaning clear.

Too much punctuation makes text crowded and difficult to read. If a sentence has
a lot of punctuation marks, it might be a sign that the sentence is too long or
complex. Try to rewrite into [shorter, clearer sentences](/node/204).

To use minimal punctuation:

* Don’t add full stops to the ends of headings, page headers, footers or captions.
* Don’t use a semicolon at the end of each item in a bullet list.
* Unless each item is a full sentence or the last item in a list, don’t use a full stop for [items in bullet lists](/node/56).
* Don’t use full stops between letters in an [acronym or initialism](/node/190).
* Don’t use a full stop at the end of most [abbreviations](/node/184).

Minimal punctuation helps users understand your content.

### Screen readers work best with minimal punctuation

Some screen readers will announce punctuation marks. Some will change the
modulation of the voice depending on the punctuation mark.

By default, screen readers that people who are blind or have low vision use, do
not usually announce punctuation. They may pause briefly when they encounter a
comma, full stop, or semicolon. They may also change inflection when they
encounter a question mark.

Screen readers usually ignore most other punctuation unless verbosity is set
high, or a person reads character by character.

### Watch out for misplaced punctuation: it can change meaning

Use punctuation marks to:

* end sentences (full stops, exclamation marks and question marks)
* break up sentences and show the relationship between words and phrases (commas, colons, semicolons, dashes, forward slashes and ellipses)
* show possession and contractions (apostrophes)
* connect related words (hyphens and dashes).

### Use the correct spacing around punctuation marks

Check the relevant topic in this manual for advice on [how to treat each
punctuation mark](/node/119).

There are different rules for putting spaces around punctuation marks. For
example, some punctuation marks have no spaces around them. Some have a space on
either side.

Include a single space after a punctuation mark at the end of a sentence. Never
use double spaces. Check each document for double and multiple spaces and delete
them.

### Capitalise the first word in a sentence and in headings

Capitalise the first word in a sentence. Use lower case for all other words,
unless those words include proper nouns. This is called ‘sentence case’.

Use sentence case for:

* [opening quoted speech within a sentence](/node/114)
* [headings](/node/51).

Do not use all capitals for headings, unless the visual design for the content
meets WCAG in all respects.

Use sentence case with italics for titles of [works mentioned in the
content](/node/181). This applies even when the reference is included in a
heading within the content.

### Minimise capitals for common nouns and adjectives

Proper nouns generally have an initial capital letter for each word in the noun.

Common nouns and adjectives don’t use initial capitals, with few exceptions. For
example, adjectives often have capitals when they refer to a [national,
religious or linguistic group](/node/133).

#### Differences between proper and common names

This manual contains [guidance for names and terms by topic](/node/117). Always
check a dictionary if in doubt.

#### Shortened forms

Use shortened forms only when this [choice supports plain English](/node/55).

Rules for capitalisation and punctuation differ from rules for terms spelt out
in full. The rules depend on where the terms are in the sentence.

The spelt-out form might not need initial capitals, even if an acronym or
initialism has them. Use normal capitalisation practices for proper and common
nouns. If in doubt, check a dictionary.

If the shortened form represents a proper noun, start each word with a capital
letter.

<example> 
‘NSW’ is written out as ‘New South Wales’.

</example>

If the shortened form represents a common noun, do not begin each word of the
full form with a capital letter.

<example> 
‘EIS’ is written out as ‘environmental impact statement’.

‘TB’ is written out as ‘tuberculosis’.

</example>

Only use capitals when the style is standardised or specified in regulations,
for symbols of [units of measurement](/node/147).

### Follow the guidance on capitals for titles and government terms

Follow conventions for using capitals for [titles, honours and forms of
address](/node/149). Use capitals when an official title precedes the name of
the office holder. This includes titles for executives specified in legislation.

Unless advised in this manual, avoid using capitals in body text for a
particular position or role within an organisation. This practice goes against
readability and does not support clarity.

You do not need to use capitals when the title is an organisational name given
to an office holder. Deference for positions within an organisation might follow
house style. Do not use house style outside of the organisational context.
Detail any special use of capitals in a [style
sheet](/node/169##a_style_sheet_is_a_useful_tool).

Preferences for capitals when the terms ‘traditional owner’, ‘elder’ and
‘custodian’ are used as titles should come directly from the relevant [First
Nations
community](/node/179##style_for_first_australian_languages_needs_to_recognise_continuing_cultures).

<example> 
Chief Defence Scientist Tanya Monro presented the award ...

</example>

Follow the rules of [capitalisation for government terms](/node/136), for
example:

* government programs and agreements
* mentions of parliament
* references to states and territories.

Legal material has its own conventions for capitalisation. Content that has a
legislative focus might use complementary sources to the [guidance on citing
legal material in this manual](/node/163).

Legal documents often use initial capitals to show terms with a defined meaning
(such as ‘Department’, ‘Schedule’, ‘Vendor’ and ‘Recipient’). In these cases,
use the form of the name as it is written in the legislation.

## Quotation marks

Quotation marks draw attention to words and reference certain kinds of titles.
Write most direct speech in single quote marks. For long quotes, use block
quotes without quotation marks.

### Quote direct speech in single quote marks

Single quotation marks are also known as ‘quote marks’, ‘quotes’, ‘speech
marks’ or ‘inverted commas’.

Use them to:

* show direct speech and the quoted work of other writers
* enclose the title of certain works
* draw attention to a word you’re defining.

Double quotation marks aren’t Australian Government style. Use them only for
quotations within quotations.
Short quotations of direct speech are enclosed in single quotation marks.

<example> 
* ‘Yes, that’s all that happened,’ she replied.
* The opposition leader asked, ‘But where’s the money going to come from?’
</example>

Don’t use quotation marks for long quotations. Instead, use block quotes.

#### Quotes within quotes

For quotations within quotations, use double quotation marks inside single ones.

<example> 
He also wrote, ‘The decisions of the department for “major procurement” were
always political choices.’

</example>

#### Omissions in direct speech

When quoting direct speech, take great care to be accurate. Writers and
publishers have been sued for inaccurate quotations attributed as direct speech.

If you use ellipses for omitted words, ensure that the omission won’t mislead
readers about the content or tone of the source you’re quoting.

<example> 
##### Correct
* He said, ‘I don’t agree with the proposal because we need to do more research.’
* He said, ‘I don’t agree with the proposal …’
</example>

If the quotation needs the information for context, add specific detail
in [square
brackets](/node/111##square_brackets_can_enclose_extra_information_within_parentheses).
You must be sure that the specific detail is correct and that it retains the
meaning intended by the original speaker.

<example> 
‘The [Queensland] government agrees.’

</example>

If you paraphrase omitted material, place the paraphrasing in square brackets.

<example> 
‘They all listened to [the new manager’s] speech.’

</example>

#### Errors in quoted material

Quoted material sometimes contains a spelling or grammatical error.

To show the error is in the original, insert an italicised ‘sic’ in
non-italicised square brackets after the error. This shows the reader that the
error comes from the original.

<example> 
The email read, ‘At the time, the population of Sydney was much higher than
Melberne [sic].’

</example>

#### Non-Australian English quotes

In quoted material use the original spelling of the quoted material, even if it
uses US spellings such as ‘color’. The capitalisation of words must also be the
same as in the original.

If the US material uses the US conventions for quotation marks, you can update
them to the Australian convention.

<example> 
###### Australian style

The President said, ‘The Prime Minister told me “No”, so I’m working on an
updated plan.’

###### US style

The President said, “The Prime Minister told me ‘No,’ so I’m working on an
updated plan.”

</example>

### Format long quotes as block quotes with no quotation marks

Quotations that are longer than about 30 words are:

* usually indented from the text margin
* sometimes set in a smaller font size or a different font.

When they are set like this, they are called ‘block quotations’.

Don’t use quotation marks to identify the quoted material – the formatting does
that instead. Block quotes should also be coded with the HTML <blockquote>
element.

<example> 
 

As Templeton (2019) writes:

According to the ACT Auditor-General, the transport benefits from the project
are projected to be lower than the costs. She noted other benefits that had been
included by the ACT Government to justify the project.

</example>

To include several paragraphs of quoted speech without the attribution tag, such
as in a media release, use a quotation mark:

* at the beginning of each paragraph
* at the end of the last paragraph only.

<example> 
 

* Dr Nicoll said, ‘My experience as a public servant helped me learn how to run workshops.
* ‘My experience also helps me make my workshops practical.’
</example>

### Write speech in transcripts and plays with no quotation marks

Quotation marks are unnecessary in transcripts and plays if the name of the
speaker comes before the direct speech.

<example> 
 

* Senator MARCELLUS: Look at the latest report. These results aren’t great.
* Dr BERNARDO: I’ve seen this happen before. It looks like we might be over budget.
</example>

The same applies for questions and answers (Q&As).

<example> 
 

Q. Have you ever been convicted of an offence, other than a parking or speeding
offence?

A. No.

</example>

### Refer to certain kinds of titles using quotation marks

When referring to these titles, use quotation marks in  [references and
citations](/node/181):

* a chapter in a book or report
* an article in a periodical
* an essay
* a lecture
* a poem
* a song.

<example> 
#### Example

 

Read the chapter titled ‘Number and natural language’ in The innate mind:
structure and contents. It describes how people learn to recognise numbers.

</example>

### Draw attention to words using quotation marks

You can use quotation marks instead of italics to make words stand out from your
sentence. Examples include:

* a technical term on its first mention in a non-technical document
* a word or phrase that has been coined or that you’re using in a specific sense
* colloquial words, nicknames, slang, or ironic or humorous words and phrases, in formal writing.

You don’t usually need to repeat the quotation marks the next time you use the
word. They might be useful if the next mention is a long way from the first.

Another use of quotation marks is for words introduced by expressions such as
‘titled’, ‘marked’, ‘the term’ and ‘defined as’.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* The papers were marked ‘Five Eyes only’.
* Can anyone here define ‘entropion’?
* The survey used the term ‘companion animal’ to describe assistance dogs in workplaces.
* He said the new policy was ‘obviously a great success’ and then explained its many failings.
</example>

### Keep quoted punctuation marks in the quote

Punctuation in and after quotation marks depends on the punctuation of the
quoted text and how it is used in the content.

If the punctuation mark is part of the quoted text, place the punctuation mark
before the closing quotation mark.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* ‘Is it okay to ask a colleague out for a coffee?’ I asked the HR section.
* He asked, ‘Has it arrived?’
</example>

The same rule applies for directly quoted speech followed by the attribution.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* ‘It has arrived,’ said the manager.
* ‘Has it arrived?’ asked the manager.
</example>

If the punctuation mark is part of the sentence outside the quoted text, it
follows the closing quotation mark.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* She said that it was ‘time to start work’.
* Many things have been called ‘the new black’, but they usually fade to grey.
* Did the complainant at any time ask you to ‘Please turn down the noise’?
</example>

Quoted material can appear as parenthetical information, enclosed
in [parentheses,](/node/111##parentheses_enclose_extra_information) [dashes](/node/199)
or [commas](/node/109). In these cases, place the quotation marks inside the
sentence punctuation.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* His stirring speech (‘We shall never surrender’) galvanised the UK and its allies.
* His stirring speech – ‘We shall never surrender’ – galvanised the UK and its allies.
* His stirring speech, ‘We shall never surrender’, galvanised the UK and its allies.
</example>

If the quotation ends a sentence or is a sentence in its own right, place the
final full stop before the final quotation mark.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* She said, ‘It’s time to start work.’
* ‘When we get the final figures,’ the manager said, ‘we’ll know how it will affect our bottom line.’
* ‘I have the final figures,’ the manager said. ‘This will ruin our bottom line.’
</example>

Sometimes, there are 2 punctuation marks – one for the quotation and one for the
sentence. Decide which is stronger and use it. Don’t use both punctuation marks.

<example> 
#### Correct

 

* The Speaker called ‘Order!’
* Did you hear him say, ‘That’s unlikely’?
</example>

The surrounding text determines the font (roman, italic, or bold) of the
quotation marks. If the content inside the quotation marks is in italics, but
the sentence is in roman, use roman for the quotation marks.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* She described it as ‘weird’. [The quotation marks are in roman even though ‘weird’ is in italics.]
* ‘Wow,’ he said. [Both the quote marks and the quote are in roman type.]
</example>

## Abbreviations

Abbreviations are shortened words. They can hinder people’s understanding, so
they have limited uses.

### Limit the use of abbreviations

Abbreviations contain the first single letter or first few letters of a word.
They don’t include the last letter of a word.

<example>
* app for ‘appendix’
* vol for ‘volume’
* cont for ‘continued’
* p for ‘page’
* para for ‘paragraph’</example>

Abbreviations are generally not good for readability and can be misunderstood.
Avoid using them in general content where possible.

<example>
Thank you for your email about errors in the third paragraph of the webpage How
to apply for a special use permit.</example>

Abbreviations are useful in very limited circumstances:

* in a table or chart, where space is unavailable for the full form of the word – provide a note under the table or chart giving the full form
* when using ‘cont’ to show continuing text in another part of content (for example, on another page of a print newsletter) – the full form of the word is more helpful where space allows.

Semi-formal and informal content uses abbreviations more often. Use
abbreviations only if users will understand what they mean. If there’s any
doubt, define the abbreviation on first use.

Avoid using abbreviations in any public-facing content.

#### Accessibility requirements

Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases, idioms and so on.

WCAG quick reference:

* [3.1.3 Unusual words – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##unusual-words)
* [3.1.4 Abbreviations – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##abbreviations)

### Don’t put a full stop after most abbreviations

Don’t place a full stop after an abbreviation.

There are exceptions:

* when the abbreviation ends a sentence and isn’t followed by another punctuation mark
* for abbreviations of scientific names for [plants and animals](/node/96)
* for the abbreviation ‘n.d.’(meaning ‘no date’) for the year of publication in references.

<example>
* It’s listed as a container of ‘misc goods’. [No full stop after the abbreviation]
* The full name of the company is Sizzling Outback Tours Inc. [A full stop after the abbreviation ends the sentence]
* Have you reviewed the relevant para? [No full stop after the abbreviation: another punctuation mark ends the sentence]
* Xanthorrhoea glauca subsp. angustifolia [Full stop in the abbreviation for ‘subspecies’]
* Office of Parliamentary Counsel (n.d.) [Glossary](https://www.legislation.gov.au/content/WhatIsIt##C), Federal Register of Legislation website, accessed 12 January 2020. [No date of publication on this webpage]</example>

### Capitalise the same way as the spelt-out version

Use the same capitalisation as for the unabbreviated word.

<example>
* misc for ‘miscellaneous’
* Dec for ‘December’</example>

### Don’t abbreviate the first word in a sentence

Write out the abbreviated term in full.

<example>
* Appendix B explains this further. [Not ‘App B’]</example>

### Add ‘s’ to create plural abbreviations

Add an ‘s’. One exception is ‘pp’ (pages), which is used when referring to
multiple pages.

<example>
* I’ve sent you some paras to check.
* Refer to pp 58–64.</example>

## Acronyms and initialisms

Acronyms and initialisms are shortened forms. They replace full names and
special terms in text. Use them only if people recognise and understand them.

### Choose acronyms and initialisms people will recognise

Acronyms comprise the initial letters (and sometimes syllables) of the words in
a term and are pronounced as a word.

<example> 
* Qantas
* Anzac
* TAFE
* modem
</example>

Initialisms comprise the initial letters (or sounds) of the words in a term and
are pronounced as letters, not as a word.

<example> 
* ABC
* GST
* NDIS
* XML
</example>

Some shortened forms are a combination of an initialism and an acronym.

<example> 
* DFAT
* EPIRB
* CPAP
* JPEG
</example>

Acronyms and initialisms are common in formal content. If understood by users,
they can make content easier to use. They communicate terms in as few letters as
possible to make content easier and faster to read.

<example> 
* CSIRO for ‘Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’
* HTML for ‘hypertext markup language’
</example>

When preparing content for well-established publications, such as professional
journals, look at the author guidelines and examples of the content. This will
show whether using acronyms and initialisms is appropriate and, if so, which
shortened forms are used.

### Explain acronyms and initialisms to all users

People unfamiliar with certain terms might not understand their shortened forms.
Acronyms and initialisms might also be misread by screen readers.

To make sure all shortened forms are accessible:

* Define them the first time you use them in content (unless you’re certain all users will understand them without a definition – consult a dictionary first).
* Include them with their spelt-out forms in the glossary. This is particularly important if the content contains many specialist shortened forms.

#### Spell out most acronyms on first use

If there’s a chance users won’t know the meaning of an acronym or initialism,
define it at first mention. Write the term in full first and follow with the
acronym or initialism in parentheses. Use the shortened form rather than the
full term for later mentions.

<example> 
* The Department of Social Services (DSS) manages a range of benefits and payments for eligible Australians. DSS helps support communities through a number of programs and services.
</example>

Write well-known acronyms or initialisms first and follow with the full term in
parentheses.

<example> 
* All living organisms have DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) within their cells. DNA tells cells what proteins to make.
</example>

You don’t need to define some acronyms and initialisms on first use. These
include:

* some place names (NT, ACT)
* time of day (am, pm)
* some organisational names (BHP, Qantas)
* terms that began as acronyms but are now words in their own right (radar, scuba, sonar).

#### Repeat the full term if the user needs it

If you use the shortened form only a few times in long-form content, consider
writing out the full term more than once.

People could come across the shortened form without reading the text where it is
first defined. For example, a user might click straight to a section that only
includes the shortened form.

### Check the correct shortened form for government organisations

The names of government departments are often shortened, but not always in the
same way.

<example> 
* DVA (Department of Veterans’ Affairs)
* Home Affairs (Department of Home Affairs)
</example>

Rather than using acronyms or initialisms, it can be easier for people if you:

* spell out the agency’s name in full the first time you use it
* then use the generic name (‘department’, ‘agency’, ‘bureau’) afterwards.

This is usually more useful to non-specialist users.

<example> 
* The Bureau of Meteorology prepares Australia’s official weather forecasts. The bureau provides its forecasts on its website.
* The Department of Finance is in Canberra. The department supports government financial management.
</example>

### Include a list if content relies on many acronyms and initialisms

For content with many specialised acronyms and initialisms, provide a glossary –
a list of terms and their meaning that users can refer to.

Include the glossary at the end of the content or on a separate webpage. Use a
hyperlink in the text to help people access the glossary.

You don’t need to include a glossary if:

* there are only a few unfamiliar shortened forms
* each one is only in a very limited section of text
* each one is spelt out when first mentioned.

#### Print considerations

The glossary usually appears before the references (with the endmatter).


### Don’t end acronyms and initialisms with a full stop

Don’t place a full stop after the acronym or initialism.

The exception is if the shortened form ends a sentence and isn’t followed by
another punctuation mark.

<example> 
 

* Will you be attending COAG this month? [No full stop after the acronym]
* I’m working on a B2B project at the moment. [No full stop after the initialism]
* She’s now working in FOI. [A full stop after the initialism that ends the sentence]
* Is the company being investigated by ASIC? [No full stop after the acronym because another punctuation mark ends the sentence]
</example>

### Use capitals for most acronyms and initialisms

Acronyms are usually all capitals, but use lower case for some familiar acronyms
(taser, captcha, laser). Use an initial capital for familiar acronyms that are
proper nouns (Qantas, Anzac).

Initialisms are often all upper case (VOIP, FOI) but there are exceptions (bpm).
Consult a dictionary if you’re unsure of the capitalisation.

If the acronym or initialism represents common nouns, don’t begin each word of
the full form with a capital letter.

<example> 
 

* EIS for ‘environmental impact statement’
* TB for ‘tuberculosis’
</example>

If the acronym or initialism represents a proper noun, start each word with a
capital letter (excluding words such as ‘of’ and ‘and’).

<example> 
#### Example

 

* ASIO [Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]
* OPC [Office of Parliamentary Counsel]
* NSW [New South Wales]
* ILSC [Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation]
</example>

### Avoid plural and possessive forms on the first use

Avoid using the plural or possessive of an acronym or initialism when you define
it. This makes it easy for users to recognise the shortened form in later
content.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* It’s compulsory for certain businesses to have an Australian Business Number (ABN). The Australian Business Register manages applications for ABNs. [There’s no need to use an apostrophe before the ’s’ for ABNs as the term is plural, not possessive.]
* The Australian National University (ANU) has a new student policy. The ANU’s policy is popular with its staff and students. [Use an apostrophe before the ’s’ to show that the ANU owns the policy.]
</example>

### Quote acronyms and initialisms the same way as the speaker

When quoting an exact phrase, write exactly what the speaker said. If they used
an acronym or initialism, quote it. Show the full term in square brackets if
users might not recognise the term or if you haven’t already explained it.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* ‘We’re continuing to manage the number of SES [Senior Executive Service] to ensure the Public Service isn’t top heavy,’ he said.
</example>

## Contractions

Contractions are shortened words. People will read and understand them depending
on their context. Avoid them in formal content.

### Shorten single words and grammatical phrases with care

Single-word contractions use the first and last letters of a word and sometimes
other letters in between.

<example> 
* Cth for ‘Commonwealth’
* Dr for ‘Doctor’ [As a title]
* Ltd for ‘Limited’ [As a legal status]
</example>

Grammatical contractions join 2 words. They use an apostrophe to show that there
are missing letters.

<example> 
* aren’t (are not)
* don’t (do not)
* isn’t (is not)
* it’s (it is)
</example>

Legal documents and many specialist and professional publications use specific
contractions. Look at examples of existing content to see whether you can use
grammatical contractions. Don’t use them if you’re unsure.

Avoid using contractions of single words in more formal content such as
high-level briefing and responses to official inquiries. The exceptions are
contractions used in formal writing, such as ‘Dr’ and other titles.

Grammatical contractions are not generally used in formal content. You can use
them in less formal content which aims to create:

* a conversational tone (for example, in a newsletter)
* a friendly or collaborative tone (for example, in brochures and manuals).

<example> 
* The department has not breached its staffing cap. [Formal high-level briefing or a response to a parliamentary question]
* The department hasn’t breached its staffing cap. [Less formal briefing or other less formal communications]
* We appreciate that the new rules weren’t advertised widely. We’re now contacting everyone who might be affected. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions. [Friendly and conversational content for users of a service]
</example>

### Find out if the user will understand the contractions

Look at existing agency content to see whether grammatical contractions are
appropriate.

If developing a new publication or communication channel, conduct [user
research](/node/76). This will help you understand how people respond to
grammatical contractions.

Some users might find grammatical contractions difficult to understand. They can
add an extra cognitive load.

### Don’t end contractions with full stops

Don’t place a full stop after contractions. The exception is when the
contraction ends a sentence and isn’t followed by another punctuation mark.

<example> 
* Tempo Australia Ltd hired him last year. [No full stop after the contraction]
* He is currently working for Tempo Australia Ltd. [A full stop after the contraction ends the sentence.]
* They said they can’t! [No full stop after the contraction because another punctuation mark ends the sentence]
</example>

Australian practice differs from US English, which adds a full stop after a
contraction (for example, ‘Mr.’, ‘Ltd.’).

Don’t use an apostrophe to show missing letters in a contraction of a single
word (‘Dr’, ‘Ltd’). Grammatical contractions use only one apostrophe, even if
the contraction leaves out letters from more than one place.

<example> 
#### Correct
* shan’t
</example>

### Capitalise contractions in the same way as the full word

Use the capitalisation that you would use for the uncontracted word.
Capitalisation of the uncontracted word depends on the context.

<example> 
* The Cth Games [The contraction ‘Cth’ is capitalised because it refers to the name of a sporting event: the Commonwealth Games.]
* A cth is a term for a political community. [Here, ‘cth’ isn’t capitalised because it’s generic.]
</example>

### Use the full word at start of the sentence (except for grammatical contractions)

Write out the contracted term in full unless it’s a grammatical contraction.

<example> 
* Commonwealth resources are available. [The word begins a sentence, so it isn’t contracted.]
* Don’t forget your notes for the meeting. [Grammatical contractions can start a sentence.]
</example>

### Only use the contraction ‘no’ with numerals

The word ‘number’ is sometimes substituted with ‘no’. This is a contraction of
the word numero. The plural form of the contraction is ‘nos’.

Only use the contraction ‘no’ when immediately followed by a numeral. In all
other instances, write the word out in full so it isn’t confused with the
negation ‘no’.

This contraction is not a standard symbol for [numbers expressed as units of
measurement](/node/147).

<example> 
* Archive box no 152 has been found in the basement.
* I won’t be able to get their manager’s number until tomorrow.
* There are a number of options available to us.
</example>

## Latin shortened forms

Use English rather than Latin shortened forms, except in some cases. People will
prefer the English equivalent unless the context requires special use.

### Avoid using Latin shortened forms in most content

Use Latin forms only in limited situations – for example:

* where there’s limited space, such as in tables
* in technical and specialist publications that use them.

Meanings of common Latin shortened formsShortened formComplete Latin wordMeaningc.circaabout, approximatelycf.conferaturcomparee.g.exempli gratiafor exampleet al.et aliiand othersetc.et ceteraand so forth, and so oni.e.id estthat isMSmanuscriptummanuscriptNBnota benetake careful notePPSpost postscriptumsecond postscriptPSpostscriptumpostscriptv., vsversusagainstviz.videlicetnamely

Unlike other shortened forms, some Latin shortened forms have full stops.

The terms ‘i.e.’ and ‘e.g.’ need full stops after each letter. This helps screen
readers announce them.

Don’t follow ‘e.g.’ or ‘i.e.’ with a comma, regardless of whether you would use
a comma in the sentence.

### Use the English words where possible

Rather than using ‘e.g.’ or ‘i.e.’ write the English words out in full. Write
‘for example’ and ‘that is’ instead, particularly in more formal publications.

<example> 
* They found some aspects of grammar confusing – for example, the different types of pronouns.
* The department has a major problem with its website – that is, users find pages are very slow to load.
</example>

Don’t use the shortened form for et cetera. Use of ‘etc.’ is redundant in a list
introduced by ‘for example’, ‘such as’ or ‘including’. These expressions show
that the list is incomplete.

If you think you need to include ‘etc.’ because there’s more to say, include
these ideas in your sentence instead.

<example> 
#### Correct
* This funding is intended for upgrading roads in Gold Coast and Hinterland urban centres (for example, Surfers Paradise and Southport).
* This funding is for upgrading roads in the Gold Coast and Hinterland urban centres (Surfers Paradise, Southport, Upper Coomera and Robina). [All the places are listed, so ‘for example’ isn’t needed.]
</example>

## Spelling

Spelling errors detract from readability. Follow one dictionary for consistency
and use it to check variable spellings.

### Choose one dictionary for consistency

Government organisations should choose one dictionary of Australian English. 

This manual recommends either:

* the Australian concise Oxford dictionary (ACOD)
* the Macquarie dictionary.

Use your organisation’s preferred dictionary as a spelling reference when you
write. Spelling and word usage can change over time. Make sure you use an
up-to-date edition that reflects current language usages.

Dictionaries include any variable spellings for words. Always use the first
entry in the list. This helps to ensure words are spelt consistently in
government content.

Only use an alternative spelling listed for a word if you have evidence it will
meet a [user
need](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/user-needs/understanding-needs/user-research-and-content).
Record decisions you make about alternative spellings in a [style
sheet](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-conventions/general-conventions-editing-and-proofreading/editing-and-proofreading##a_style_sheet_is_a_useful_tool).

The entry for a spelling can expand on changes to the basic form of a word.
These changes show things like the plural, past tense, or the root from which a
word is formed. These changes are called ‘inflections’ and ‘derivations’.

Dictionaries will also show

#### Specialist dictionaries

General dictionaries won’t meet all needs. Other dictionaries may have helpful
features, for example:

* more details on origins of words (etymologies)
* clearer examples
* word division for breaking words over lines of text
* appendices.

Specialist dictionaries are essential for scientific or technical writing. The
style sheet for the content should include specialist terms.

### Dictionaries describe language usages

English is a global language. There are many regional varieties of written and
spoken English. Dictionary spellings capture standard English words.
Dictionaries also capture words and usages particular to varieties of English,
including Australian English.

Dictionaries are descriptive not prescriptive. They describe how people actually
use and spell English rather than prescribing rules for using English correctly.
Dictionaries objectively record language for the people who speak it.

This is why dictionary entries include different meanings for each word and
alternative spellings. The important thing is to use the word that matches the
meaning you want to convey.

Most words have a single spelling. This can lead people to assume there is
always a ‘correct spelling’. But spellings aren’t uniform or consistent around
the world. Australian, British and American English share words that have the
same meaning, but can be spelt differently.

Australian spellings generally follows British spellings, but there are
exceptions. For Australian spellings, always use an Australian English
dictionary.

In addition, style guides (like the Style Manual) usually have guidance for
their users about how to write specific terms and phrases.

### Follow guidance in this manual

The Style Manual has specific guidance about writing certain terms and phrases
correctly.

Follow our guidance for:

* [names and terms, including Australian place names](/node/117)
* [titles, honours and forms of address](/node/149)
* [numbers and measurements](/node/138)
* [terms that support inclusion](/node/178)
* [common misspellings and word confusion](/node/121).

There is also guidance related to spelling at [punctuation and
capitalisation](/node/116).

### Spelling in this manual

The spelling in this manual follows the sixth edition of the ACOD. This
dictionary reflects Australian English usage.

Style Manual also recognises conventions and spellings particular to government
content.

The spellings used by Australian Government organisations that follow the
Macquarie dictionary might differ from those in this manual. This is perfectly
acceptable – choose either of our recommended dictionaries (or a specialist
dictionary) and follow it consistently. 

Always follow our guidance for specific terms and phrases.

Users might notice that the Style Manual departs from some spellings used in the
sixth edition. For example, we now write ‘ement’ not ‘ment’ in acknowledgement,
lodgement and judgement (but we use ‘judgment’ for [legal
material](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-conventions/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material)).
This is consistent with current advice in Australian English dictionaries.

## Common misspellings and word confusion

When words sound similar or the same, people can confuse their spelling. If
you’re not sure about the spelling of a word, check a dictionary. 

### Check for words that are easily confused or misspelt

The spelling of some words is variable. Sometimes it’s difficult to know which
spelling or word to use because:

* Australian, American and British English have different ways of spelling a word
* a word might sound similar to another, so people can mishear it and write the wrong word.

Follow one dictionary for consistency and use it to check variable
[spellings](/node/30).

### Choose the right word and spell it correctly

Correct word use makes content readable and clear to users. Getting words wrong
risks losing users’ engagement with, and trust of, your content.

This alphabetical list contains some of the words that people get wrong in
government writing. Check your dictionary for the full set of meanings of each
word.

<example> 
##### Example

‘regardless’. It is not accepted as standard Australian English.

<example> 
##### Example

 

Our aim is for all staff to have access to this training, regardless of
location.

The following instructions will work regardless of which mobile platform you
use.

These are interesting times but we must carry on regardless.

</example>

#### that/which

The words ‘that’ and ‘which’ are both relative pronouns.

They should not be used interchangeably. Your choice can alter the meaning of
your sentence.

To make your writing clear, use:

* ‘that’ for essential information
* ‘which’, with punctuation, for non-essential information.

For examples, refer to [guidance about
pronouns](/node/131##relative_pronouns_show_essential_or_nonessential_information).

#### their/there/they’re

The word ‘their’ is the possessive form of ‘they’. It shows ownership.

The word ‘there’ means ‘in or at a position or location’. It is also used to
introduce sentences.

If you‘re leaving for the conference now, I’ll have to meet you there later.

There is a problem we need to manage.

They’re all in a meeting until 2 pm.

</example>

#### would have/would of

Sometimes people mishear the verb form ‘would have’ as ‘would of’. Always write
‘would have’ or the contracted form ‘would’ve’. ‘Would of’ is incorrect.

<example> 
##### Correct

 

If I had known we were over budget, I would have changed the scope of the
contract.

This would’ve spared us a lot of stress

</example>

## Academics and professionals

Follow these rules to address and title academics and professionals correctly.
The guidance focuses on academics, medical practitioners, dentists and
veterinarians. Apply the rules when writing about individuals in other
professions.

### Use initial capitals for the titles of individual academics and professionals

The academic and professional titles held by individuals usually have initial
capitals. This includes honorary titles.

Use lower case if you use a title [generically](##generic).

<example>
* Adjunct Professor Monty Chiratte [Honorary academic title]
* All general surgeons at the hospital attended Wednesday’s forum. [Generic use]</example>

### Use full titles in certain contexts

Academics and professionals are often addressed by their ‘full title’. A full
title includes the title or honorific (with initial capitals), name,
post-nominals, position and organisation.

Use a full title:

* to introduce an individual as speaker
* in address and signature blocks in correspondence
* in official records of proceedings
* in lists in organisational publications such as annual reports
* if it is important to know where an individual works.

A full title is often about using titles in a display or presentation context
(display text).

<example>
* Professor Margaret Sheil AO, Vice-Chancellor and President, Queensland University of Technology [Full title]</example>

### Titles immediately before a name

Use initial capitals for titles that appear immediately before a person’s name.
Do this unless the title is [generic](##generic).

Also use initial capitals for the [shortened
forms](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases)
of titles.

<example>
* Our new vice-chancellor and president is Professor Rufus Black.
* We welcome Dr Jamilah Mulyadi to our clinic. Dr Mulyadi is now available for skin examinations.</example>

#### Shortened forms for titles immediately before a name

Only use shortened forms of titles in limited circumstances. People might
understand common contractions like ‘Prof’ for ‘Professor’, but some shortened
forms are confusing. For example, the initialism for ‘Pro Vice-Chancellor’ is
‘PVC’. To ensure your content is readable, write the title in full.

Shortened forms are sometimes necessary because of limited space. For example,
shortened forms often appear in tables. List the full form of any title that
people might find confusing in a
[note](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/tables##add_notes_to_provide_sources_or_help_interpret_the_data).

The space available for image captions can be limited, but write the full names
and titles as a default. If you have to use initials and the shortened forms of
titles in a caption, always include the full forms in body text to provide
context.

‘Dr’ is an exception in all instances. Like ‘Ms’ and ‘Mr’, ‘Dr’ is easy to
understand when it appears before a name.

<example>
* Departmental officers recently attended Upsilon University’s annual Copyright Symposium. The academic panel (pictured below), chaired by Vice-Chancellor Tom Dhillon, discussed recent cases with implications for fair dealing provisions of the Copyright Act 1968. [Body text: spelt-out titles]
* Left to right: Associate Professor Sara Baird, Vice-Chancellor Tom Dhillon, Dean Frank Ealing, Adjunct Professor Olena Iraklidis, Dr Celia Nieminen [Image caption: preferred style]
* Left to right: Assoc Prof S Baird, VC T Dhillon, Dean F Ealing, Adj Prof O Iraklidis, Dr C Nieminen [Image caption: only for limited space]</example>

### Titles that replace a name

Use initial capitals for official titles that replace a name.

Titles replacing a name also have initial capitals:

* when you address someone directly
* for salutations in correspondence.

For all other uses, titles that replace a name should be lower case.

These other uses include abbreviated titles and titles given by an organisation
to a role or position. Academic and professional organisations might capitalise
such titles as a mark of respect or status, but this is not [Australian
Government
style](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation##follow_the_guidance_on_capitals_for_titles_and_government_terms).
Treat them as generic and use lower case.

<example>
* The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania visited last week. [Initial capitals: official title replacing name]
* The vice-chancellor visited Burnie campus last week. [Lower case: abbreviated title replacing name]
* Dear Chancellor [Initial capital: salutation]
* ‘We note your concerns Doctor. Thank you for bringing this evidence before the committee’. [Initial capital: direct address]</example>

### Titles after a name

Use lower case for most titles that appear after a name. These titles describe
the individual and are generic.

There is one exception. Only use initial capitals for titles after a name in a
[full title](##full).

This includes for:

* address and signature blocks in [correspondence](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/format-writing-and-structure/content-formats/emails-and-letters)
* lists in organisational publications such as annual reports.

Follow your organisation’s template style for signature blocks. Templates apply
design elements and list all elements in correct order. Some organisations
prefer all capitals for names, titles and the organisation’s name.

<example>
* They met with Associate Professor Dianne Stephens OAM, medical director of the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre.  [Lower case: generic descriptive title in body text]
* Associate Professor Dianne Stephens OAM, Medical Director, National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre  [Initial capitals: full title]
* Professor Chris Goodnow FAA FRSExecutive DirectorGarvan Institute of Medical Research384 Victoria StreetDarlinghurst NSW 2010Australia  [Initial capitals: full title for address block]
* Dr Fatima Dashti FASMDirector (Research)Institute for Virusestelephoneemailwebsite  [Initial capitals: full title for signature block. Order of elements might vary.]
* ##LIVE ##COVID Update with Professor Paul Kelly, Australian Government Chief Medical Officer, Department of Health. [Initial capitals: full title to introduce speaker in government video.]
* ##### 2021 Innovation Award recipients
  Dr Joanne ZhengSenior Research ScientistAcmeCo AustraliaProfessor Alexander
  BannonSenior Lecturer in Rehabilitation MedicineFaculty of Health and Medical
  SciencesUniversity of Adelaide[Initial capitals: full titles for list in annual
  report]</example>

### Use lower case for titles used in a generic way

Generic use of academic and professional titles includes:

* titles that describe a named individual
* plural titles
* common nouns.

As shown in the previous section, most titles that appear after a name are
generic.

Some titles appearing immediately before a name are also generic because they
describe the individual. These titles are usually preceded by ‘the’ or a
modifier. Adjectives are modifiers because they restrict the meaning of a noun.

<example>
* Professor Bartlett, the university’s vice-chancellor, welcomed alumni to the reception. [Lower case: descriptive title after a name]
* The research fellow Lydia Mbegngue wrote extensively on this topic. [Lower case: title before a name, modified by ‘the’]
* Several postdoctoral fellows in the research facility met last week. [Lower case: plural title]
* A provost oversees a university’s academic performance. [Lower case: common noun]
* Dhriti Saxena is a local doctor in general practice. [Lower case: common noun and descriptive title after a name]
* They met with former medical director Tom Perera. [Lower case: title immediately before a name, modified by ‘former’]
* Two doctors from this practice attended the conference. [Lower case: plural title]
* It is important to see your doctor to develop an asthma action plan. [Lower case: common noun]</example>

### Use title, name and post-nominals at first mention

When you write about an individual, it’s respectful to use their title.

The first time you mention someone in body text, use their academic or
professional title before their first name and last name, followed by
post-nominals.

If you mention the individual again, only use the title and last name. Some
academic titles have an accepted abbreviated title you can use after the first
mention.

<example>
* Emeritus Professor Stephen Duckett has extensive experience in health care at senior leadership level. Professor Duckett’s membership of the RMIT Council concludes in 2022.
* [‘Professor’ is the accepted abbreviated title for an Emeritus or Emerita Professor.]</example>

Never use the shortened form of the title in body text (‘Prof’ for example),
except for the contraction ‘Dr’.

<example>
This year’s graduate cohort asked Deputy Vice-Chancellor Jonquil Johansson to
moderate their debate.</example>

### Write post-nominals after the name in academic and professional titles

Post-nominals are letters after a name that stand for academic, civil and
military [awards and
honours](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/awards-and-honours).

Make sure you write post-nominals [in the right
order](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/awards-and-honours##use_postnominals_in_the_correct_order).

Don’t use commas before or between post-nominals.

<example>
* Professor Sally Wheeler OBE MRIA FAcSS FAAL</example>

#### Use post-nominals at first mention only

The first time you write a name in body text, use the academic and professional
title along with the first and last name. Include the post-nominal for a civil
or military honour in the title.

If you mention the name again, use the title and last name, but don’t include
the post-nominal.

<example>
* Dr Ziggy Switkowski AO has been chancellor of RMIT since 2011. Dr Switkowski is also chair of NBN Co.</example>

#### Include post-nominals in the shortened forms of titles

Retain any post-nominals for civil and military honours when using the shortened
forms of titles.

<example>

##### Example

* Attendees: Dr Z Switkowski AO, Prof M Bean CBE, Dr S Andrews, Ms J Latchford, Prof S Duckett, Ms T McLaughin and Mr D Hoogstra. [Extract from minutes of a university council meeting]</example>

#### Use post-nominals for academic and professional qualifications in 2 contexts

Post-nominals can also stand for tertiary and professional qualifications.

Use these post-nominals:

* for correspondence within the academic community
* to show relevant expertise.

Don’t include both ‘Dr’ (doctorate) and ‘PhD’ (Doctor of Philosophy) for the one
name. It is conventional to use either the title or the post-nominal. This also
applies to PhD equivalents such as ‘LLD’ (Doctor of Laws).

Don’t include post-nominals for master and bachelor degrees in correspondence.

<example>

##### Example

* Dr Zdenka Svoboda or Zdenka Svoboda PhD [Individual with doctorate]
* Dr Amin Salke MD FRACGP [Medical practitioner]
* Brent Hulot CPA [Accountant]
* Mark Price BEngTech TMIEAust [Engineer]
* Mia Lillard BCom CFP [Financial planner]</example>

### Titles for academics

In most contexts, address academics with their full title: title or honorific,
name, position, post-nominals and academic institution.

<example>

#### Example

* Associate Professor Peter Spencer, College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, Murdoch University [Full title]
* Distinguished Professor Larissa Behrendt AODirector of ResearchJumbunna Institute for Indigenous Education and ResearchUniversity of Technology SydneyPO Box 123Broadway NSW 2007Australia    [Full title: address block]</example>

#### An academic who is knighted

Use ‘Sir’ or ‘Dame’ after the academic title.

<example>

##### Example

* Chancellor Dame Leonie Kramer AC DBE
* Chancellor Sir Albert Axon KBE</example>

#### Emails and letters to academics

Keep the initial capital for the title in correspondence when you’re writing to
a specific person.

In formal correspondence:

* Open with ‘Chancellor’ (or ‘Vice-Chancellor’, ‘Professor’ and so on).
* Conclude with ‘Yours faithfully’.

In less formal correspondence:

* Open with ‘Dear Chancellor’ (or ‘Vice-Chancellor’, ‘Professor’ and so on).
* Conclude with ‘Yours sincerely’.

Don’t include a comma after these phrases. Australian Government style is to
write salutations without punctuation.

<example>
Dear Associate Professor … Yours faithfully

Dear Assistant Professor … Yours sincerely</example>

How to address associate and assistant professors correctly in correspondence
differs by country and educational institution.

For Australian correspondence, write ‘Dear Associate Professor’ and ‘Dear
Assistant Professor’ not ‘Dear Doctor’ or ‘Dear Professor’.

#### People with doctorates

You can address people who hold a doctorate as ‘Doctor’ or ‘Dr’ (without a full
stop). Today, it is acceptable to use ‘Dear Dr Name’ for both formal and
informal correspondence.

When writing ‘Dear’ without the person’s name in emails and letters, write the
title ‘Doctor’ in full.

Don’t include a comma after these phrases.

<example>

##### Example

* Dear Dr Muecke
* Dear Doctor</example>

#### A holder of a doctorate who is knighted

If the holder of a doctorate is knighted, don’t address them as ‘Doctor’.

Instead, address the person by ‘Sir’ or ‘Dame’. Write the post-nominals for the
knighthood after the name, followed by any other post-nominals. Don’t insert
commas before or between the post-nominals.

<example>

##### Example

* Dame Bridget Ogilvie AC DBE FRS FAA</example>

### Titles for medical practitioners, dentists and veterinarians

Use ‘Doctor’ or ‘Dr’ for medical practitioners, dentists and veterinarians,
whether or not they hold a doctorate. Those with a doctorate may choose to add
the post-nominal ‘PhD’.

Use ‘Professor’, ‘Associate Professor’ or ‘Assistant Professor’ for doctors who
hold these titles at academic institutions. Some doctors who hold professorships
choose to use ‘Dr’ when working in clinical practice.

Surgeons in human medicine are traditionally called ‘Mr’, ‘Ms’ or their
preferred gender-appropriate honorific. Some surgeons prefer to use ‘Dr’. For
example, a search of the website of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons
shows that council members use ‘Dr’, ‘Miss’, ‘Mr’, ‘Ms’, ‘Professor’ and
‘Associate Professor’.

It is best to contact the doctor’s practice if you are unsure of their preferred
honorific. You are unlikely to cause offence if you use the title (or honour)
awarded most recently.

<example>

#### Example

* Doctor Farida Khan [Medical practitioner]

## Australian Defence Force

Use the correct title and style to refer to members of the armed services. This
guidance is intended primarily for users outside the Department of Defence and
the Australian Defence Force.

### Use terminology correctly

Use the term ‘Defence’ when you mean both the Department of Defence and the
Australian Defence Force (ADF). ‘Defence’ is used to represent the organisation
as a whole.

‘Defence’ has an initial capital when it is part of a [formal name or
title](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/nouns##proper_nouns_are_the_names_of_people_and_specific_things).
Use lower case for generic references.

Use ‘Australian Defence Force’ and ‘ADF’ when referring to the Royal Australian
Navy, Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, commanded by the [Chief of
the Defence
Force](https://www.defence.gov.au/about/leaders/chief-defence-force).

Use ‘Department of Defence’ when referring to the department, headed by the
[Secretary of the Department of
Defence](https://www.defence.gov.au/about/leaders/secretary).

<example>
* Defence engages with industry to deliver procurement outcomes that support departmental and ADF capability.
* The institute’s paper examines the implications for our defence strategy over the next decade.
* The aim is to support Australian Defence Force personnel and their families as they transition from military to civilian life.
* The Department of Defence operates under the Public Service Act 1999.</example>

### Follow the order of precedence for the 3 arms of the ADF

There are 3 arms of the ADF, known collectively as the ‘services’ (‘Services’
inside Defence). When referring to the services, follow the order of precedence
established by the [Defence Act
1903](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2021C00371):

* Royal Australian Navy
* Australian Army
* Royal Australian Air Force.

Always use initial capitals when writing the short names of the services:

* Navy
* Army
* Air Force.

<example>
* Defence Reserves are an essential part of the Navy, Army and Air Force</example>

### Address members of the ADF by rank, name and post-nominals

Use the following order to address members of the ADF:

* rank
* given name or initials
* family name
* post-nominals
* service (for commissioned officers in the Navy only).

Do this:

* the first time you write their name in body text
* in address blocks in correspondence
* when introducing an ADF member as speaker
* in official records of proceedings
* in lists in organisational publications such as annual reports.

ADF ranks are listed in the table ‘[Ranks and salutations](##ranks)’.

<example>
* Rear Admiral Robert W Plath AM RAN
* Lieutenant General Susan Coyle AM CSC DSM
* Air Marshal Mel Hupfeld AO DSC
* [Don’t use commas]</example>

If you mention the name again in body text, use rank and family name.

<example>
* Chief Petty Officer Ray Rosendale CSM is a Kuku Yalanji man of the Western Sunset Clan. He was born in Nambour and joined the Navy in 1991. Chief Petty Officer Rosendale now has a role advising the Navy on First Nations cultural affairs.</example>

#### Only one rank has a hyphen

Write military ranks of more than one word as separate words. Do not hyphenate
the rank.

There is one exception from the Air Force: Air Vice-Marshal. It is always
hyphenated.

<example>
* Acting Sub Lieutenant DW Midson RAN
* Warrant Officer Class One K Felmingham NSC OAM
* Air Vice-Marshal Catherine Roberts AM CSC</example>

#### Post-nominals

Post-nominals are letters after a name that stand for academic, civil and
military [awards and
honours](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/awards-and-honours).

Write post-nominals after the family name. Place post-nominals before the
shortened form showing service (‘RAN’).

Make sure you write post-nominals in the [right
order](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/awards-and-honours##use_postnominals_in_the_correct_order).

Don’t use commas before or between post-nominals.

<example>
* Commander Algirdus Diciunas MBE CSM RAN
* Lieutenant General Natasha Fox AO CSC
* Air Commodore Michael Kitcher AM DSC</example>

#### Use ‘RAN’ to indicate Navy service for commissioned officers

Use ‘RAN’ (Royal Australian Navy) for all commissioned officers of the Navy.
Place ‘RAN’ after the family name and any post-nominals.

Don’t use an acronym to show service for officers in the Army or Air Force.

In Defence, ‘RAN’ is used to distinguish naval officers from officers in the
other services and from naval officers in other countries.

Gazettal notices of Australian awards and honours follow this style. For
consistency, the Style Manual recommends that Australian Government
organisations also follow this practice.

<example>
* Captain Catherine Wilsen AO [Army]
* Captain Stephen Beckmann AO CSC RAN [Navy]</example>

#### Write the rank before the title of ADF members who are knighted

When someone has a military rank and another title such as ‘Sir’, ‘Dame’ or ‘the
Honourable’, place the military rank first.

<example>
* General Sir John Monash GCMG KBE VD</example>

### Address chaplains and maritime spiritual wellbeing officers by title

Army and Air Force chaplains wear military rank.

Navy chaplains and maritime spiritual wellbeing officers (MSWOs) do not wear
military rank. Instead, they wear chaplaincy or MWSO insignia and a service
badge with the symbol of their faith or purpose. This gives them ‘floating
rank’, meaning they take on the rank of the person they are talking to.

Address chaplains with their chaplaincy title, not a military rank.

MSWOs have been part of the Navy since 2020. Address them with their MSWO title,
not a military rank.

Include any post-nominals.

The chaplaincy titles are:

* Principal Chaplain (Navy and Army) and Principal Air Chaplain (Air Force)
* Senior Chaplain (Navy) and Chaplain (Navy, Army and Air Force).

The MSWO titles include:

* Principal Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officer
* Senior Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officer
* Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officer.

<example>
* Principal Chaplain Darren Jaensch [Army]
* Principal Air Chaplain Kevin Russell CSC GAICD [Air Force]
* Senior Chaplain Brian Rayner OAM RAN [Navy]
* Chaplain Catherine Inches-Ogden CSC [Army]
* Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officer Tammy Dunne [Navy]</example>

### Address retired officers of the ADF by rank

Commissioned officers who retire can continue to use their military rank. When
writing their name, use their rank and include ‘(Retd)’ after any post-nominals.

<example>
* General the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove AK CVO MC (Retd)</example>

### Avoid using the shortened forms of ranks

For internal Defence use, it is common to write the ranks in abbreviated form
using capital letters.

Don’t follow this convention in other types of content. Write the full rank with
an initial capital letter.

<example>
Lieutenant T Smith [Outside Defence]</example>

### Address members of the ADF correctly in emails and letters

The style rule for address blocks applies to all members of the ADF.

The style rule for salutations changes with rank.

#### Address blocks

To write an address block, follow all preceding rules on this page.

The style of address blocks is the same for all ranks.

* rank
* given name or initials
* family name
* post-nominals
* ‘RAN’ for commissioned officers in the Navy
* ‘(Retd)’for retired commissioned officers who retain rank
* postal address.

<example>

#### Salutations

The Style Manual follows the ADF’s style for salutations.

The style of salutations depends on [rank](##ranks).

Don’t include post-nominals in salutations.

Never add a comma after salutations.

##### Commissioned officer ranks

**Rule: Dear [Rank]**

Use the rule for these ranks:

* Admiral, Rear Admiral, Commodore and Captain (Navy)
* General, Lieutenant General, Major General, Brigadier and Colonel (Army)
* Air Chief Marshal, Air Marshal, Air Vice-Marshal, Air Commodore and Group Captain (Air Force).

<example>

* Wing Commander, Squadron Leader and Flight Lieutenant (Air Force).

<example>

###### Example

* Lieutenant Commander Siobhan Sturdy CSM RAN [Address block]

Use the rule for these ranks:

* Sub Lieutenant, Acting Sub Lieutenant and Midshipman (Navy)
* Lieutenant, Second Lieutenant and Officer Cadet (Army)

ADF style is to use a conventional title before the family name for these ranks.

Use the honorifics ‘Ms’, ‘Mr’, ‘Mx’, ‘Mrs’ or ‘Dr’ when it is possible to
identify the appropriate title. If this is difficult, follow the ‘Dear [Rank
Family name]' rule.

<example>

###### Example

* Officer Cadet Dean Collins OAM [Address block]

* Warrant officer of the Air Force to Aircraftman/Aircraftwoman (Air Force).

<example>

###### Example

* Lance Corporal A Fenech BM [Address block]
* Dear Lance Corporal Fenech [Salutation]</example>

##### Chaplains and MSWOs

Salutations for ADF chaplains and maritime spiritual wellbeing officers do not
change with rank.

**Rule: Dear [Chaplaincy title]**

**Rule: Dear [MSWO title]**

<example>

###### Example

* Chaplain Jui-Hsiang Su CSM [Address block]Dear Chaplain [Salutation]

## Awards and honours

Post-nominals and titles of status show the awards and honours an individual
has. List them in the correct order.

### Use post-nominals in the correct order

Post-nominals are the shortened forms for academic awards and civil and military
honours.

There is an [order in which to write the
post-nominals](https://www.pmc.gov.au/resource-centre/government/post-nominals).

In summary, the rule is to write the highest honour first. The order is:

* post-nominals for honours and awards
* King’s Counsel (KC) or Senior Counsel (SC) or Justice of the Peace (JP)
* university degrees and diplomas

Don’t use:

<example> 
* Professor Fiona Wood AM FAHMS
* The Hon Ken Wyatt AM MP
* The Hon Linda Burney MP
</example>

### Write titles before a person’s name in the correct order

Vice-regal and ecclesiastical titles and Australian Defence Force ranks usually
precede all other titles.

Follow these with any other titles (such as ‘Dame’, ‘Sir’ and ‘Dr’) immediately
before a person’s name.

<example> 
* His Excellency General the Honourable David Hurley AC DSC (Retd)
* The Right Reverend Dr Sarah Macneil
* General Sir John Wilton KBE CB DSO
</example>

## Diplomats

Use the correct term when referring to ambassadors, high commissioners, nuncios
and other diplomatic staff. 

### Use the correct term when referring to diplomats

The title for diplomats depends on what they represent:

* High commissioners represent Commonwealth countries.
* Ambassadors represent non-Commonwealth countries.
* Nuncios represent the Holy See, the governing body of the Roman Catholic Church.

#### Use initial capitals for the titles of high commissioners, ambassadors and nuncios

Use initial capitals when writing to ambassadors, high commissioners and
nuncios.

<example> 
* His Excellency Mr Babar Amin, High Commissioner for Pakistan
</example>

The pronouns ‘His’ and ‘Her’ are part of the title. Write these with an initial
capital as well.

#### Address high commissioners, ambassadors and nuncios with ‘His Excellency’ or ‘Her Excellency’

#### Emails and letters to ambassadors, high commissioners and nuncios

In formal correspondence with ambassadors, high commissioners and nuncios:

* Open with ‘Your Excellency’.
* Conclude with ‘Yours faithfully’.

In informal correspondence:

#### Address other diplomatic staff by name and appointment

Use the name and official position to address:

* diplomatic staff (such as chargés d’affaires and counsellors)
* consular appointees (such as consuls general, vice-consuls and honorary consuls).

<example> 
* Mr John Smith, Chargé d’Affaires

## Parliaments and councils

Refer to members of Australian parliaments and councils in the correct style.
Follow these rules to address and title people correctly.

### Capitalise the titles of the current prime minister and treasurer

Capitalise the titles of the current holders of the positions of:

* Prime Minister
* Treasurer.

Do this even when the titles are abbreviated.

If referencing prime ministers or treasurers generically, use lower case.

<example>
* The Prime Minister announced the new initiative this morning.
* The PM announced the new initiative this morning. [Less formal]
* Terms of office vary for prime ministers around the world. [Generic]
* The Treasurer will present the mid-year report tomorrow.
* In many countries treasurers are preparing responses to this latest development. [Generic]</example>

Use lower case letters for former prime ministers and treasurers of Australia.

<example>
* Alfred Deakin served 3 terms as prime minister of Australia.
* Australia’s first female prime minister was Julia Gillard, who took office in 2010.
* Peter Costello remains the longest-serving treasurer in Australian history.</example>

### Capitalise titles for current senators and members of the Australian Parliament

The Parliament of Australia website has instructions for [how to address
senators and
members](https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Contacting_Senators_and_Members/How_to_address_Senators_and_Members).

Write these titles as follows:

* the Prime Minister
* the President of the Senate
* the Speaker of the House of Representatives
* ministers (Senate)
* ministers (House of Representatives)
* assistant ministers (Senate)
* assistant ministers (House of Representatives)
* senators
* members (House of Representatives).

People elected to the upper house take the title ‘Senator’ before their given
name.

<example>
* Senator Claire Chandler</example>

Members of the House of Representatives take the initialism ‘MP’ after their
name. Write it after any other post-nominals. Don’t use commas before or between
post-nominals.

<example>
* Ms Zali Steggall OAM MP</example>

### Address certain office holders of the Australian Parliament as ‘Honourable’

Use the title ‘Honourable’ for ministers (including the prime minister) and
parliamentary secretaries in the Australian Parliament. The title is given to
these office holders because they are members of the [Federal Executive
Council](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice7/HTML/Chapter2/Federal_Executive_Council).
They retain the title for life.

The abbreviation for ‘Honourable’ is ‘Hon’ without a full stop.

<example>
* The Hon Chris Bowen MP, Minister for Climate Change and Energy [Serving minister]
* The Hon Darren Chester MP [Serving MP and former minister]
* The Hon Warren Entsch MP [Serving MP and former parliamentary secretary]</example>

Use the title ‘Senator’ before ‘the Honourable’ if the minister or parliamentary
secretary is a member of the Senate.

<example>
* Senator the Hon Penny Wong, Minister for Foreign Affairs</example>

#### The presiding officers and former office holders of state parliaments

The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives (the
presiding officers) use the title ‘Honourable’.

* former members of state ministries
* former presiding officers of state parliaments.

<example>
* Senator the Hon Susan Lines, President of the Senate
* The Hon Milton Dick MP, Speaker of the House of Representatives
* The Hon Bob Katter MP [Former minister in the Queensland Government]</example>

In formal emails and letters to a minister:

* Open with ‘Dear Minister’.
* Conclude with ‘Yours faithfully’.

In less formal correspondence:

* Open with ‘My dear Minister’.
* Conclude with ‘Yours sincerely’.

### Use the appropriate form for members of state and territory parliaments

In formal emails and letters, address members of state and territory parliaments
with the relevant post-nominal after their name.

#### Number of chambers in state and territory parliament

The parliaments of all states except Qld are ‘bicameral’. This means parliament
has 2 chambers or houses:

* the Legislative Council – also called the ‘upper house’
* the Legislative Assembly (NSW, Vic and WA) or House of Assembly (SA and Tas) – also called the ‘lower house’.

The parliaments of Qld, the ACT and the NT are ‘unicameral’. This means
parliament has one chamber or house – the Legislative Assembly.

#### Use the correct post-nominal

Members of state and territory parliaments use the post-nominal:

* MLC (Member of the Legislative Council)
* MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly)
* MP (Member of the Legislative Assembly or Member of the House of Assembly).

All bicameral parliaments use the post-nominal 'MLC' for members of their upper
houses.

The choice of 'MLA' or 'MP' for members of state and territory parliaments is
less clear-cut.

Follow these rules to use the correct post-nominal.

Use MLC for members of the Legislative Council of:

* NSW
* SA
* Tas
* Vic
* WA.

Use MLA for members of the Legislative Assembly of:

* ACT
* NT
* WA.

Use MP for members of the Legislative Assembly of:

* NSW
* Qld
* Vic.

Use MP for members of the House of Assembly of:

* SA
* Tas.

<example>
* The Hon Nicolas Pierre Goiran MLC
* Ms Tara Cheyne MLA
* Mr Danny O'Brien MP
* Dr Amy MacMahon MP</example>

A parliamentarian may have other post-nominals after their name. These can
include:

* civilian and military honours
* educational and professional qualifications.

If so, write these in the same way the parliamentarian does. If you’re unsure,
check with the parliamentarian’s office.

#### Emails and letters to members of a state or territory parliament

In formal correspondence with a member of a state or territory parliament:

* Open with ‘Dear Ms’ (or ‘Mr’, ‘Mrs’, ‘Mx’, ‘Dr’ and so on).
* Conclude with ‘Yours faithfully’.

In less formal correspondence:

* Open with ‘Dear Mr’ (or ‘Ms’, ‘Mrs’, ‘Mx’, ‘Dr’ and so on).
* Conclude with ‘Yours sincerely’.

#### Address certain office holders in state and NT parliaments as ‘Honourable’

Use ‘Honourable’ when addressing all members of the executive councils of the
states and the NT:

* premiers and ministers in all states
* chief minister and ministers in the NT
* former ministers in all states and the NT.

Use ‘Honourable’ when addressing these parliamentarians:

* members of all state legislative councils except in Vic
* Leader of the Opposition in Tas
* presidents of all legislative councils
* speakers of all parliaments except in the ACT.

<example>

Office holders in the ACT Legislative Assembly don’t use the title ‘Honourable’.
Ministers in the ACT have more than one portfolio. Address emails and letters to
them using the ministerial title appropriate to the topic.

<example>
* Ms Joy Burch MLA, Speaker of the ACT Legislative Assembly
* Ms Rachel Stephen-Smith MLA, Minister for Health
* Ms Rachel Stephen-Smith MLA, Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs
* Ms Rachel Stephen-Smith MLA,  Minister for Families and Community Services</example>

#### Address state premiers correctly

Address state premiers as ‘The Hon [given and family names] MLA/MP, Premier of
…’

Check the premier’s website to see whether they include other post-nominals in
their title, such as academic or professional qualifications.

<example>

##### Example

* The Hon Peter Malinauskas MP, Premier of South Australia
* The Hon Roger Cook BA GradDipBus (PR) MBA MLA, Premier of Western Australia</example>

In formal emails and letters with a premier:

In formal emails and letters with the chief minister:

* Open with ‘Dear Chief Minister’.
* Conclude with ‘Yours faithfully’.

In less formal correspondence:

* Open with ‘Dear Chief Minister’.

### Address mayors and members of local governments with the correct title

Address members of local governments in urban and regional areas differently.

Check the current title of a mayor or local government member to ensure
accuracy. Check with the mayor’s or member’s office if you’re unsure.

#### Mayors of state capital cities

Use the title ‘The Right Honourable the Lord Mayor of [the name of the city]’
for lord mayors of:

* Adelaide
* Brisbane
* Hobart

* The Right Worshipful the Lord Mayor of Wollongong, Mr Gordon Bradbery AM</example>

Address mayors of other cities as ‘His’ or ‘Her Worship the Mayor of [name of
city]’.

<example>

##### Example

* Her Worship the Mayor of Fremantle, Ms Hannah Fitzhardinge</example>

In correspondence:

* Open with ‘Dear Mayor’ (or ‘Dear Lord Mayor’ if applicable).
* Conclude with ‘Yours faithfully’.

#### Shire presidents, aldermen and councillors

Address a shire president as ‘President [family name]’. The abbreviation for
‘President’ is ‘Pres’ without a full stop, but use the full title ‘President’
because it’s clearer.

<example>
##### Example

* President Smith</example>

Address an alderman (regardless of gender) as ‘Alderman [family name]’. The
abbreviation for ‘Alderman’ is ‘Ald’ without a full stop.

<example>
##### Example

* Alderman Miller
* Ald Miller</example>

Address a councillor as ‘Councillor [family name]’. The abbreviation for
‘Councillor’ is ‘Cr’ without a full stop.

<example>
##### Example

* Councillor Brown
* Cr Brown</example>

In formal emails and letters:

* Open with ‘Dear President’, ‘Dear Alderman’ or ‘Dear Councillor’ as appropriate.
* Conclude with ‘Yours faithfully’.

In less formal correspondence:

* Open with ‘Dear President’, ‘Dear Alderman’ or ‘Dear Councillor [family name]’.
* Conclude with ‘Yours sincerely’.

## Royalty, vice-royalty and nobility

Royalty and representatives of the royal family should be addressed with their
correct title.

### Always capitalise the titles of current royals

Always use capitals for the title of the current Australian monarch.

The full title of the current monarch of Australia is ‘Charles the Third, by the
Grace of God King of Australia and His other Realms and Territories, Head of the
Commonwealth’.

<example>
* His Majesty The King
* Next week, the King will visit Australia.</example>

Address letters to the King to his private secretary.

<example>
* To the Private Secretary to His Majesty The King</example>

#### The royal family

The title of the King’s wife, Queen Camilla, is ‘Her Majesty The Queen’.

The title of the late Queen Elizabeth II is ‘Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II’.

The title of the late Queen’s husband, Prince Philip, is ‘His Royal Highness The
Duke of Edinburgh’.

The King’s elder son, Prince William, is titled
‘His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales’.

Prince William’s wife, Catherine, is titled
’Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales’.

Address letters to Prince William to his private secretary. You can use
the shortened form for ‘His Royal Highness’ in this instance.

<example>
* To the Private Secretary to HRH The Prince of Wales</example>

Use an initial capital for ‘The’ for the formal titles of the King and his
immediate family.

<example>
* The Prince George
* The Princess Royal</example>

### Use regnal numbers (I, II, V) for titles of monarchs and religious leaders

Regnal numbers are upper case roman numerals that are used for the titles of
monarchs and popes.

Don’t use digits or ordinal numbers, even though you might pronounce them like
that.

<example>

#### Correct

* Margrethe II
* Rama IX
* Gewargis III</example>

#### Use a non-breaking space for names with regnal numbers

Put a non-breaking space between the name and the regnal number. A non-breaking
space means that line breaks won’t split up both elements of the name. The name
and number will stay together on one line.

You can insert a non-breaking space using the Unicode character U+00A0.

In HTML, use the entity &nbsp; to insert a non-breaking space. You can also use
the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar in Word.

##### Print considerations

Use a narrow no-break space between the name and the regnal number.

The narrow no-break space ensures that the:

* name and number stays together on one line
* spacing between name and number doesn’t change when text is justified.

You can insert a narrow no-break space using the Unicode character U+202F.

### Capitalise ‘Governor-General’ when it’s part of the formal title

The position of governor-general in Australia is known as vice-royalty. The
Governor-General represents the King in Australia.

Address the Governor-General of Australia in the following style and order:

* ‘His/Her Excellency the Honourable’
* prefixed titles
* given name and family name
* post-nominals
* ‘Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia’.

You might need to vary the order of the items in the title to suit the titles of
the incumbent. For example, place:

* military rank before ‘the Honourable’
* ‘Sir’ or ‘Dame’ after ‘the Honourable’.

<example>
* His Excellency General the Honourable David Hurley AC DSC (Retd), Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia
* Her Excellency the Honourable Dame Quentin Bryce AD CVO, Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia</example>

When you are referring to the generic term, use lower case ‘governor-general’.
When you are referring to 2 or more people who hold or have held the title, use
lower case and refer to them as ‘governors-general’.

<example>
* Australia has had 28 governors-general. A governor-general’s role is to represent the monarch.</example>

#### Correspondence to the Governor-General

Address correspondence to the Governor-General to the Official Secretary at
Government House, Canberra.

To address the Governor-General personally in formal correspondence:

* Open with ‘Your Excellency’.
* Conclude with ‘Yours faithfully’.

In less formal correspondence:

* Open with ‘Dear Governor-General’.
* Conclude with ‘Yours sincerely’.

For the partner of the Governor-General:

* Address a female partner as ‘Her Excellency’ or ‘Your Excellency’.
* Address a male partner as ‘His Excellency’ or ‘Your Excellency’.

## Types of words

Keep the functions of words in mind to write clear content. Grammar and sentence
structure help people understand meaning.

### Words are grouped by function

Each word has a function in a [sentence](/node/120), [clause](/node/143) or
[phrase](/node/144). You can group words into different types depending on the
way they function.

Functions include:

* [adjectives](/node/126)
* [adverbs](/node/127)
* [conjunctions](/node/129)
* [determiners](/node/132)
* [nouns](/node/122)
* [prepositions](/node/130)
* [pronouns](/node/131)
* [verbs](/node/128).

Functional categories for words are also known as ‘parts of speech’.

### Sentence structure sets the function of words

Many individual words can belong to different word types. This depends on what
the word is doing in the sentence.

The function of the word depends on the role it plays in combination with
others.

<example> 
* You can face penalties for using a still to make alcohol without the proper licence. [‘Still’ is a noun.]
* The dinghy was floating in still water. [‘Still’ is an adjective.]
* The people stood still during the national anthem. [‘Still’ is an adverb.]
</example>

You can change the meaning of a sentence by moving a word.

Place modifying words, such as adjectives and adverbs, next to the thing that
they’re modifying. The same applies to adverbial and adjectival phrases and
clauses.

If you don’t put the modifier in the right place, people will find it difficult
to understand your content.

The following sentences are all grammatically correct. The meaning changes as
the modifier ‘only’ is moved.

<example> 
Only Jamilah told Freddie that she respected him. [No one else told Freddie.]

Jamilah only told Freddie that she respected him. [Jamilah didn’t write to
Freddie. She just told him.]

Jamilah told only Freddie that she respected him. [Jamilah didn’t tell anyone
else she respected him. She also didn’t tell anyone else that she respected
them.]

Jamilah told Freddie only that she respected him. [Jamilah didn’t tell Freddie
anything else.]

Jamilah told Freddie that only she respected him. [No one else respects
Freddie.]

Jamilah told Freddie that she only respected him. [Jamilah doesn’t have any
other opinion of Freddie.]

Jamilah told Freddie that she respected only him. [Jamilah doesn’t respect
anyone else.]

</example>

Fixing a misplaced modifier is more complicated. Sentences with this issue often
need some rewriting.

<example> 
The report suggested that the drug is beneficial, even though it’s harmful in
larger doses. [‘It’ in the modifier refers to ‘the drug’.]

</example>

## Adjectives

Adjectives describe, compare and define nouns and words that act as nouns. Use
adjectives to help people understand meaning.

### Adjectives describe nouns

Adjectives describe [nouns](/node/122), [noun
phrases](/node/144##noun_phrases_function_as_a_noun) and [noun
clauses](/node/143).

Adjectives usually go immediately before the noun. They can go elsewhere in a
sentence – for example, as [a predicate](/node/120).

<example>
* They had a short conversation. [The adjective ‘short’ describes the noun ‘conversation’.]
* Their conversation was short. [The adjective ‘short’ describes the noun ‘conversation’, but appears as the predicate in this sentence.]</example>

Adjectives also modify noun phrases and noun clauses.

<example>
* They had a short conversation about the meeting. [A noun phrase]
* They had a short conversation that led to a decision. [A noun clause]</example>

Different types of words, such as nouns, can also function as adjectives.

<example>
* A moving speech brought the sound of applause. [A verbal noun (gerund) functioning as an adjective]</example>

### Adjectives can affect clarity

Use adjectives sparingly and only when they are essential for meaning. Remove
any adjective that doesn’t play a critical function in a [sentence](/node/204).

Because adjectives are modifiers, they can affect clarity. A lack of clarity can
cause users to lose trust in government content.

### Compound adjectives can have hyphens

Adjectives can be joined with [hyphens to make compound
adjectives](/node/105##use_hyphens_for_some_compound_words). A compound adjective
usually has a hyphen if the adjective is before the noun it is describing.

<example>
* We need a fit-for-purpose strategy to solve this specific problem. [Adjective before the noun ‘strategy’]
* The strategy is fit for purpose. [Adjective after the noun ‘strategy’]</example>

A compound adjective can be made up of an [adverb](/node/127) and a
[verb](/node/128).

A common error with adverbs and hyphens is when people insert a hyphen into this
kind of compound adjective. Don’t use hyphens with most adverbs finishing in
‘-ly’.

<example>

#### Correct

* A badly worded sentence can be difficult to read, even if it is grammatically correct.</example>

There are few exceptions to this rule, so check a dictionary if you are unsure.

### Most adjectives use different degrees for comparisons

Degree shows the relative scale of the words being described, such as speed,
size or quality. Most adjectives can have ‘degree’.

These adjectives usually follow the pattern of adding ‘-er’ or ‘-est’ to the end
to show the degree.

<example>

##### Positive

Claire is a fast talker. [There is no comparison. Claire is fast.]

##### Comparative

Sam is a faster talker than Claire. [Adds ‘-er’ to compare Claire’s and Sam’s
talking speed.]

##### Superlative

Sam is faster than Claire, but Petra is the fastest of them all. [Adds ‘-est’ to
compare Petra’s talking speed to that of the others.]</example>

Not all adjectives follow the regular pattern of ‘fast–faster–fastest’. These
irregular adjectives have different patterns.

<example>
* little, less, least
* good, better, best
* bad, worse, worst</example>

Some adjectives don’t have a different form to show degree. They show degree by
using ‘more’ for comparative or ‘most’ for superlative.

<example>
* The department decided on a more flexible approach to working arrangements.
* This is the most significant reform of public health policy in decades.</example>

Some adjectives don’t have degree because you can’t compare them. For example,
nothing can be more unique than something else.

### There is a common order for strings of adjectives

Write strings of adjectives in an order that creates a more
natural-sounding English. This order is determined by the types of adjectives
used. List adjectives in this order:

1. evaluative – features of a noun that you can measure or compare
2. descriptive – features of a noun that you can’t measure
3. definitive – features of a noun that are intrinsic to the noun.

Evaluative adjectives can also express an opinion.

<example>
* A beautiful round committee table</example>

In this example:

* ‘beautiful’ is evaluative because it expresses an opinion
* ‘round’ is descriptive because it’s a feature you can observe but can’t measure
* ‘committee’ is definitive because it is intrinsic to the noun ‘table’.

Strings of adjectives have:

* commas between adjectives of the same type
* no commas between adjectives of different types
* no commas and no ‘and’ before definitive adjectives.

<example>
* A large, black nuclear submarine [‘Large’ and ‘black’ are descriptive; ‘nuclear’ is definitive.]
* A new, red long-range electric car [‘New’ and ‘red’ are descriptive; ‘long-range’ and ‘electric’ are definitive.]</example>

You can also use ‘and’ instead of [commas to help the sentence flow more
smoothly](/node/109).

<example>
* A new and shiny red long-range electric car</example>

### The meaning of nouns and adjectives shouldn’t overlap

Don’t use an adjective if it repeats a quality or property that is part of the
noun.

<example>

#### Example

* absolute perfection [Perfection is always absolute.]
* added bonus [All bonuses are added.]
* emergency situation [An emergency is always a situation.]
* future prospect [Prospects are always in the future.]</example>

## Adverbs

Adverbs modify meaning when they’re added to a sentence. Use them occasionally
to show people how, when, where, or the extent to which something happens.

### Adverbs add more information about other types of words

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs. They often, but not always,
end in ‘-ly’.

<example> 
* The staff worked happily. [Modifies the verb ‘worked’]
* The staff arrived early this morning. [Modifies the verb ‘arrived’]
* She is a very dedicated worker. [Modifies the adjective ‘dedicated’]
* You finished quite quickly. [Modifies the adverb ‘quickly’]
</example>

### Adverbs can affect clarity

Use adverbs sparingly. Remove any adverb that doesn’t play a critical function
in a [sentence](/node/204).

Because adverbs are modifiers, they can affect clarity. A lack of clarity can
cause users to lose trust in government content.

### Comparison with adverbs is by degree

Like adjectives, adverbs can have degree to show or imply a comparison. In
general, you simply add the word ‘more’ or ‘most’ in front of the adverb.

Depending on the context, some [words can be adjectives or adverbs](/node/203).
Make sure you use the correct form. For example, ‘quickest’ is the adjective and
‘most quickly’ is the adverb.

<example> 
##### Comparative

Bob spoke more quickly than Tom. [Uses ‘more’ to compare Tom’s and Bob’s
speaking speed]

##### Superlative

Tom speaks more quickly than Bob, but Harry speaks the most quickly of them all.
[Uses ‘most’ to compare Harry’s speaking speed to that of the others]

</example>

Not all adverbs follow this regular pattern of using ‘more’ or ‘most’ to show
comparison. The following examples show irregular adverbs.

<example> 
* He spoke well, but she spoke better.
* You finished work early, but they finished even earlier.
</example>

Adverbs don’t always show or imply comparison. These are called positive
adverbs.

<example> 
* Tom spoke quickly. [Tom’s speaking speed is not compared with anything else.]
* The staff worked happily. [We don’t know if they worked more happily than others.]
</example>

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions join whole sentences or parts of a sentence together. They can show
people how ideas are linked, or how ideas contrast.

### Conjunctions join words, phrases and clauses

Use conjunctions to connect words, [phrases](/node/144) and
[clauses](/node/143).

Examples of conjunctions are:

* and
* but
* or
* because
* when.

<example> 
* The team met early because the manager requested it.
* Print the page in black and white, please.
* Lee wanted casual or part-time work.
* Give me a call when you have finished the report.
</example>

### Some conjunctions are paired

Some conjunctions come in pairs, such as ‘whether/or’, ‘either/or’ and
‘neither/nor’. Each conjunction in the pair should appear before the same type
of word, phrase or clause.

<example> 
* Whether rain or shine, we’re going ahead with the team-building exercise. [Both conjunctions pair with a noun.]
* My manager and I discussed both my performance review and my career prospects. [Both conjunctions pair with a noun phrase.]
* Either we complete the report today, or we work on it tomorrow. [Both conjunctions pair with clauses.]
</example>

### Coordinating conjunctions join things of equal importance

Coordinating conjunctions include ‘and’, ‘but’ and ‘or’. They link words,
phrases and clauses that are of the same importance.

<example> 
* The Australian Defence Force will build new patrol boats and submarines. [Joining nouns]
* Work quickly but carefully. [Joining adverbs]
* The answer is true or false. [Joining adjectives]
* The content designers had Post-its on the wall and on the floor. [Joining phrases]
* Schools reopened so students returned. [Joining clauses]
</example>

Coordinating conjunctions can also join clauses that could stand alone as
sentences.

<example> 
Keep the sentence simple otherwise the message will get lost.

</example>

### Subordinating conjunctions join clauses and phrases to a main clause

Subordinating conjunctions join the main clause to a subordinate (or
‘dependent’) clause or phrase.

The main clause can stand alone as a sentence. Dependent clauses add to the main
clause: they depend on it to [form a complete sentence](/node/120).

Examples of subordinating conjunctions are:

* when
* if
* unless
* until
* because
* since.

<example> 
* When you get to work, please phone your new client. [‘Please phone your new client’ is the main clause; ‘when you get to work’ is the dependent clause.]
* Take care of your health as though your life depends on it. [‘Take care of your health’ is the main clause; ‘your life depends on it’ is the dependent clause.]
</example>

### Some adverbs work as conjunctions

A conjunctive adverb is a word that does 2 things at the same time.

* It joins 2 main clauses.
* It modifies a verb, an adjective, another adverb or a whole clause.

They are weaker connections than coordinating or subordinating conjunctions.

<example> 
A quick guide outlines the issue, besides detailing other sources on the topic.

</example>

Conjunctive adverbs are often not needed. They add nuance to writing, but use
them sparingly. You can usually delete them and keep meaning clear.

<example> 
* The deadline was still weeks away; however, it was going to be tough to meet. [The adverb ‘however’ links 2 main clauses.]
* The deadline was still weeks away. It was going to be tough to meet. [No adverb links the 2 main clauses.]
</example>

### ‘With’ is not a conjunction

Don’t use ‘with’ to add a clause at the beginning or end of a sentence. Reword
or split the sentence to prevent this misuse. This helps create shorter, simpler
sentences that are easier to read.

<example> 
#### Correct
The lake has had several blue-green algae outbreaks this year. It has been
closed to swimming at least once a year since 2002.

</example>

## Determiners

Determiners always go with a noun. They tell people something specific or
general about the noun.

### Determiners are ‘articles’ that go with nouns

Determiners introduce a [noun](/node/122) or a [noun phrase](/node/144).
Determiners give more information about the noun they are introducing. They are
also called ‘articles’.

They show users:

* which things you are referring to
* whether you are referring to specific or to generic things and ideas
* how many things there are.

Determiners include:

* articles such as ‘a’, ‘an’ or ‘the’
* pronouns such as ‘those’, ‘my’ or ‘some’
* numbers such as ‘2’, ‘14’ or ‘23 million’.

### Definite articles refer to a specific thing or things

The word ‘the’ is the ‘definite article’. It defines which specific thing you
are referring to.

<example> 
They finished the report on time and on budget. [This sentence refers to a
specific report.]

</example>

You can use ‘the’ for a group of things, but only if you refer to a specific
group.

<example> 
The employees were on time for the meeting. [Specific employees were on time.]

</example>

Don’t use ‘the’ when you make a generalisation.

<example> 
People work in offices. [This is a generalisation about people and offices.]

</example>

### Indefinite articles let you make generalisations

The words ‘a’ and ‘an’ are ‘indefinite articles’. Use them when you are
referring to a generic thing or idea rather than a specific one.

<example> 
* A school should teach a child how to read and write. [This could be any school and any child.]
* An EL2 usually supervises several staff. [This could be any EL2.]
</example>

Choose ‘a’ or ‘an’ according to the sound of the word after it:

* Use ‘a’ if the following word starts with a consonant sound.
* Use ‘an’ if the following word starts with a vowel sound.

The same rule applies to shortened words and phrases
([abbreviations](/node/184), [acronyms and initialisms](/node/190), and
[contractions](/node/191)).

Some vowels have a hidden ‘y’ consonant sound at the beginning. For example, you
would read ‘universal’ as ‘yew-nee-ver-sahl’.

Say the noun out loud. If it starts with the hidden ‘y’ sound, use ‘a’.

<example> 
* It was an error. [The ‘e’ sound in ‘error’ is a vowel.]
* It was a cold office. [The ‘c’ sound in ‘cold’ is a consonant.]
* The job required a university degree. [The ‘u’ sound in ‘university’ sounds like the consonant ‘y’.]
</example>

For words that start with ‘h’:

* Use ‘an’ only before words that start with a silent ‘h’, such as ‘honour’ or ‘hour’.
* Use ‘a’ for all other words starting with ‘h’, such as ‘historian’ or 'hotel’, when the ‘h’ is spoken.

### Pronouns can function as determiners

Some pronouns introduce nouns, so they work as determiners. Examples of these
pronouns are ‘any’, ‘some’, ‘this’, ‘that’, ‘these’, ‘those’, ‘my’, ‘your’,
‘his’, ‘her’.

Pronouns, working as determiners, can show which noun you are referring to.

<example> 
* Write some instructions.
* Those meetings were long but fruitful.
* Give it your best shot.
</example>

Pronouns can also quantify the noun.

<example> 
* Every public servant knows the code of conduct.
* Most reports are well written.
* Few people have time to fill out forms.
</example>

### Numbers can function as determiners

Numbers work as determiners because they give information about how many nouns
they are introducing.

<example> 
* They had 2 meetings.
* This is my second cup of coffee for the day.
* This month, the minister delivered 3 keynote addresses.
</example>

## Nouns

Nouns are the words that name people, places, organisations and things. Style
and grammar support how people interpret nouns in content.

### Proper nouns are the names of people and specific things

Any name for a specific person, organisation, place or thing is a ‘proper noun’.

Proper nouns always start with capital letters, except for [some commercial
terms](/node/89).

<example> 
* June
* Shark Bay
* Collingwood Football Club
* Torres Strait Regional Authority
* Prime Minister of Australia
</example>

There are specific capitalisation conventions for the:

* [titles of office holders](/node/149)
* [names of organisations](/node/88)
* [government terms](/node/136).

### Common nouns are words for generic things

Common nouns describe people, places, times or things in a general sense. They
have a capital letter only when they are the first word in a sentence.

<example> 
* month
* coast
* local government
* prime ministers
</example>

Capitalise nouns only if they are part of a proper noun. Don’t capitalise them
if you use them as common nouns.

<example> 
* The ACT’s Office of the Commissioner for the Environment was the first such agency in Australia. [‘Office’ is part of the formal title.]
* I worked in the office for 11 years. [‘Office’ is not part of the formal title, even if it refers to the Office of the Commissioner for the Environment.]
</example>

### Common nouns can be concrete or abstract

Concrete nouns name things you can identify through one or more of the 5 senses.

<example> 
* server
* phone
* software
* person
</example>

Abstract nouns name intangible things. These include ideas, emotions and
physical feelings.

<example> 
* honesty
* reliance
* engagement
* admiration
</example>

Some nouns can be either concrete or abstract, depending on the context.

<example> 
* The office is upstairs. [Concrete noun]
* Alfred Deakin was the first to hold the office of Attorney-General in Australia. [Abstract noun]
</example>

### Verbal nouns are also called ‘gerunds’

Gerunds are nouns that form by attaching an ‘-ing’ to a verb.

<example> 
* meet [verb], meeting [noun]
* report [verb], reporting [noun]
</example>

You can combine gerunds and other verbal nouns with a
[determiner](/node/132##pronouns_can_function_as_determiners) (such as ‘my’ or
‘your’).

<example> 
* Your writing has improved. [‘Your’ is the determiner; ‘writing’ is the noun; ‘has improved’ is the verb.]
* They resent Bill’s laughing at them. [‘Bill’s’ is the determiner; ‘resent’ is the verb; ‘laughing’ is the noun.]
</example>

Verbal nouns also include nouns that relate to verbs in another way. For
example, the noun can form by adding other types of suffix to a verb like
‘-ation’ or ‘-ment’. These are not gerunds.

<example> 
 

* fixation [Noun related to the verb ‘fix’]
* attachment [Noun related to the verb ‘attach’]
</example>

Other verbal nouns don’t have any suffix but have the same spelling as the verb.
It is context that gives the distinction.

<example> 
 

* ‘fix the issue’ [verb], ‘a quick fix’ [noun]
* ‘report an issue’ [verb], ‘annual report to the minister’ [noun]
</example>

### Nouns can be singular or plural

Nouns can be singular or plural. Most English words add an ‘-s’ or ‘-es’ to form
the plural, but there are many exceptions. Check a dictionary if you’re not
sure.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* a computer, many computers
* a policy, many policies
* the standby, many standbys
* the Attorney-General, many attorneys-general
</example>

Some nouns don’t change to form the plural.

<example> 
#### Example

 

an aircraft, many aircraft

</example>

Don’t use an apostrophe before (or after) the ‘s’ to show the plural.

<example> 
#### Correct

 

Adjust the desks and chairs.

</example>

### Collective nouns describe a group in a single word

Collective nouns are a type of common noun. They label groups of people or
things.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* crowd
* committee
* cluster [for example, of desks]
</example>

#### Subject–verb agreement

A collective noun usually has a [singular verb](/node/128). This is so, even if
it’s made up of component parts.

<example> 
##### Correct

 

* The government intends to act.
* The committee is meeting.
</example>

An exception is when you need to draw attention to the individual parts of the
collective noun.

<example> 
##### Example

 

* The branch meets once a week. [‘The branch’, as a whole, meets once a week. The singular form of the verb is used.]
* The branch are divided over the new meeting schedule. [The individuals in ‘the branch’ have different opinions about the new meeting schedule. The plural form of the verb is used.]
</example>

### Nouns can be countable or uncountable

You can sort nouns by whether they can be separated into individual units and
counted:

* You can count countable nouns.
* You cannot count uncountable nouns.

<example> 
#### Example

 

Would you like a cup of coffee or tea? [‘Cup’ is countable; ‘coffee’ and ‘tea’
are uncountable.]

</example>

A countable singular noun must have a determiner.

<example> 
#### Correct

 

* The report is being printed.
* Our report is being printed.
</example>

An uncountable noun has no plural and only a singular verb. Uncountable nouns
don’t need to have a determiner. Whether it has one depends on the meaning of
the sentence.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* Respect is an Australian Public Service value. [No determiner with ‘respect’. The value is not quantifiable.]
* The leadership avoided a spill. [‘The’ is the determiner with ‘leadership’. The noun refers to a single, specific group of people.]
</example>

Some nouns can be used both ways. The meaning depends on whether the noun is
countable or uncountable in the way it is used:

* In the uncountable form, it refers to the whole idea or quantity.
* In the countable form, it refers to a specific example or type.

<example> 
#### Example

 

* Language is powerful. [In this context, ‘language’ is uncountable.]
* Australians speak many languages besides English. [In this context, ‘language’ is countable.]
</example>

### Noun trains are hard to understand

Strings of 3 or more nouns are known as ‘noun trains’. Each noun in a noun train
modifies the next.

Rewrite a sentence to avoid using a noun train. This will help you [write in
plain language](/node/55).

<example> 
 

The agency’s new system will help to improve how it manages injuries. [No noun
train]

</example>

## Prepositions

A preposition creates relationships between words or phrases. Some words only
work with specific prepositions. Choose them deliberately to convey meaning to
users. 

### A preposition creates relationships between words or phrases

Prepositions show a relationship between a [noun](/node/122) or
[verb](/node/128). Use prepositions to give information about the time and place
of an action or thing.

Examples of prepositions are:

* in
* before
* around
* since
* between.

Prepositions often come before related words or [phrases](/node/144).

<example>
* Put the book on the table. ['On' shows the position of 'the book' in relation to 'the table'.]
* During her time in office, she launched 50 projects. ['During' refers to 'her time'; 'in' refers to 'office'.]
* They had many discussions about the restructure. ['About' refers to 'the restructure'.]</example>

You can use some prepositions as a different type of word, depending on their
function in the sentence. For example, 'down' can be a preposition, part of a
verb or an adverb.

<example>
* I walked down the hill. ['Down' is a preposition.]
* Prices came down from an all-time high. ['Down' is part of the phrasal verb 'came down'. 'From' is the preposition.]
* Please read down to the bottom of the page. ['Down' is an adverb describing the verb 'read'.]</example>

### Some words only work with specific prepositions

Not all prepositions work for every word or phrase. Some words are always
followed by particular prepositions. For example, 'different' is always followed
by 'to' or 'from', but not by 'than'. Check a dictionary if you are not sure.

<example>

#### Correct

* This is different from that.
* The discussion about the program is continuing.</example>

## Pronouns

Pronouns replace other words. People will find content easier to read when
pronouns match their context.

### Pronouns stand in for other words

Pronouns stand in for [nouns](/node/122). They stand in for groups of words that
function as nouns ([noun phrases](/node/144) and [noun
clauses](/node/143##subordinate_clauses_depend_on_the_main_clause)). They can
also act like [determiners](/node/132).

<example> 
* I, he, she, they, it
* myself, yourself, ourselves
* who, which, that
* any, several
</example>

Pronouns can be singular or plural.

<example> 
* I, we
* she, they
* me, us
</example>

### Types of pronouns function as different types of words

There are 6 main types of pronouns:

* Personal pronouns replace the names of people or things. They include ‘I’, ‘me’, ‘we’, ‘us’, ‘it’, ‘they’, ‘them’, ‘she’, ‘her’, ‘he’ and ‘him’.
* Reflexive pronouns reflect the action of the verb back to the subject. They include ‘myself’, ‘ourselves’, ‘itself’, ‘themself’, ‘themselves’, ‘herself’ and ‘himself’.
* Relative pronouns refer to nouns that are already known from the context. They include ‘who’, ‘whom’, ‘whose’, ‘which’ and ‘that’.
* Interrogative pronouns ask questions. They include ‘what’, ‘which’, ‘who’, ‘whom’ and ‘whose’.
* Demonstrative pronouns specify which noun you are referring to. They include ‘this’, ‘that’, ‘these’ and ‘those’.
* Indefinite pronouns don’t specify quantity or number. They include ‘any’, ‘each’, ‘several’ and ‘some’.

Some pronouns can work as other types of words. For example, ‘my’, ‘his’,
‘hers’, ‘our’, ‘their’ and ‘your’ work as determiners.

<example> 
* I gave her the report. She gave me a card. [Personal pronouns]
* I told myself I could finish on time. [Reflexive pronoun]
* The person who wrote the report has left. [Relative pronoun]
* Who left the lights on in the office? [Interrogative pronoun]
* This is mine. That one is yours. [Demonstrative pronouns]
* Do you have any feedback? Yes, I have some. [Indefinite pronouns]
</example>

Singular pronouns have a gender-neutral form. Use the forms:

* ‘they’ instead of ‘he’ or ‘she’
* ‘them’ instead of ‘him’ or ‘her’
* ‘their’ instead of ‘his’ or ‘hers’.

### Pronouns take different forms depending on their function

The form of a pronoun will change depending on whether it is the subject or the
object of the verb. This is the ‘case’ of the pronoun.

A pronoun used as the subject in a sentence is in the subjective case (for
example, ‘I’, ‘they’).

A pronoun used as the object in a sentence is in the objective case (for
example, ‘me’, ‘them’).

<example> 
* I emailed them. [‘I’ is the subject and ‘them’ is the object.]
* They emailed me. [‘They’ is the subject and ‘me’ is the object.]
</example>

When the singular ‘they’ is used in a sentence as a
[gender-neutral](/node/64##use_genderneutral_language) term, it takes the plural
form of a verb.

Use the correct case when writing pronouns. Check whether the pronoun should be
in the subjective or the objective case – whether it is the [subject or
object](/node/120##a_full_sentence_is_grammatically_complete).

<example> 
#### Correct
* My colleague and I travelled with the delegation.
* My manager sent their director and me an email.
</example>

Sentences can have reflexive pronouns when the subject is also the object of the
verb.

<example> 
The manager emailed themself. [‘Themself’ is the object but refers to ‘the
manager’, which is the subject.]

</example>

Don’t use a reflexive pronoun if the subject and the object are not the same
person or thing.

<example> 
#### Correct
I emailed myself.

</example>

Don’t use reflexive pronouns such as ‘yourself’ and ‘myself’ as the subject of
the verb.

<example> 
#### Correct
My colleague and I travelled with the delegation.

</example>

### Relative pronouns show essential or non-essential information

To make your writing clear, use:

* ‘that’ for essential information
* ‘which’, with punctuation, for non-essential information.

It is important to show users whether information is essential or non-essential
by using punctuation, for example
[commas](/node/109##mark_out_nonessential_information_within_a_sentence).

<example> 
 

* The farm that produces oats is for sale. [The only farm that is for sale is the one that produces oats.]
* The farm, which produces oats, is for sale. [The farm, which happens to produce oats, is for sale.]
</example>

Choosing between relative pronouns can be a matter of style in some situations,
depending on [voice and tone](/node/40). It is the use of punctuation with the
relative pronoun that clarifies meaning.

## Verbs

Verbs express when something happened, or that something is continuing or
finished. Verbs help people make sense of other parts of a sentence or clause.

### Verbs describe an action, a state, an event or a change

Verbs are words that describe:

* an action
* a state
* an event
* a change.

<example>
* to work, to discuss, to try [actions]
* to be, to have, to seem [states]
* to happen, to occur, to result in [events]
* to become, to grow, to dissolve [changes]</example>

The form of the verb changes depending on the grammatical subject and tense.

### Verbs must ‘agree’ with the subject

The form of the verb changes to show whether the subject is singular or plural
(the number). This is called ‘subject–verb agreement’.

<example>

#### Correct

The analyst works in the office on Mondays. [There is one specific analyst, so
the verb takes the singular form ‘works’.]</example>

To decide which form of the verb you need, find its subject and ask ‘who’ or
‘what’ is doing the verb. Using the first example:

* Question: Who works in the office on Mondays?
* Answer: The analyst.

This answer might seem obvious, but subject–verb agreement is not always
intuitive. For example, a common mistake is to use the plural form of a verb
with a [collective
noun](/node/122##collective_nouns_describe_a_group_in_a_single_word).

Sentences contain at least [a subject and a
verb](/node/120##a_full_sentence_is_grammatically_complete). Keep
the relationship between the grammatical subject and the verb clear to users.
This relationship is the basis for writing [plain language
sentences](/node/204##write_plain_language_sentences).

### Objects complement some verbs

Some verbs need an object to have meaning. For example, you don’t just need or
take – you need ‘something’ or take ‘something’. These are ‘transitive’ verbs.

<example>
* They need advice before the hearing. [‘Advice’ is the object of the verb ‘need’.]
* Take my advice. [‘My advice’ is the object of the verb ‘take’.]</example>

Some verbs don’t have an object. These are ‘intransitive’ verbs. Intransitive
verbs can instead have a complement in the form of an [adverb](/node/127) or
[adverbial phrase](/node/144).

<example>
* The power grid failed. [The verb ‘failed’ does not have an object.]
* The candidate campaigned tirelessly. [The verb ‘campaigned’ does not have an object. ‘Tirelessly’ is an adverb. The adverb complements the verb.]</example>

Some verbs can be transitive or intransitive. They can have meaning with or
without an object, depending on the rest of the sentence.

<example>
* They opened the door. [The object is ‘the door’.]
* The door opened. [‘Opened’ has no object.]</example>

A complement can go with a verb that links the subject to an attribute, quality
or characteristic. This type of complement is not an object, but completes the
sentence. They are often [adjectival
phrases](/node/144##adjectival_phrases_function_as_adjectives) or
[adjectives](/node/126).

<example>
* The door is open. [‘Open’ complements the verb ‘is’. It is an adjective that describes the subject, ‘the door’.]
* The forecasts seem reasonable. [‘Reasonable’ complements the verb ‘seem’. It is an adjective that describes the subject, ‘the forecasts’.]
* Each agency has its own arrangements. [‘Its own arrangements’ complements the verb ‘has’. The complement is a noun phrase describing an attribute of the subject, ‘each agency’.]</example>

### Tense changes the form of the verb

The form of the verb can also change to show:

* when something happened (past, present or future) – this is the tense of the verb
* whether something is continuing or has finished.

<example>
* I was writing the report last week, but I couldn’t finish it. [The action is in the past tense and is continuing. I didn’t finish writing the report last week.]
* I wrote the report yesterday. [The action is in the past tense and has finished.]
* I am writing another report today. [The action is in the present tense and it is continuing.]
* I will write a final report tomorrow. [The action is in the future tense and it will be finished tomorrow.]
* By next week, the executive will have reviewed the report. [The action is in the future tense and will be finished by next week.]</example>

Verbs like ‘will’ change the form of the main verb ‘to write’. Verbs added to
the main verb are ‘auxiliary’ verbs.

### The ‘mood’ of a verb conveys meaning

You can use verbs to describe a fact, express a wish, or make a command or
request. The term for this use is ‘mood’.

#### Indicative mood

This mood expresses simple statements or questions.

<example>
* Jan went into the office on Monday.
* The commander ordered the troops to stand at ease.
* Was the report tabled in July this year?</example>

#### Imperative mood

This is the mood for expressing urgency, commands, pleas and requests.

The imperative mood is direct. It works well for instructions and where there is
limited space, such as in [forms](/node/177).

<example>
* Apply now.
* Lodge your submission by 31 July.
* Verify your corporate credit card.</example>

Be deliberate about the tone the content needs to convey. Imperative commands
can seem blunt, even if you use the word ‘please’.

<example>
Please speak up.</example>

#### Subjunctive mood

This is the mood for expressing possibility. It shows that something is
hypothetical, possible, conceivable or desirable.

<example>
* If supply were to stop, we wouldn’t be able to meet demand.
* If only they would update the data!
* You should apply now.</example>

Verbs in the subjunctive mood can work together with other words to express a
condition.

<example>

##### Example

* If you took a sample, you would have some data.
* If you applied now, we could process your application tomorrow.</example>

The subjunctive mood doesn’t always need an auxiliary verb to show the mood,
only the main verb. Recommendations can follow this formula.

<example>

##### Example

Recommendations

* That the Minister meet with peak body representatives.</example>

You can use auxiliary verbs to convey ability, possibility, permission or
obligation. This affects the [tone of your writing](/node/40).

These verbs are:

* can
* could
* may
* might
* will
* would
* shall
* should
* must
* ought to.

<example>

##### Example

* This could take some time.
* You must submit your application by close of business.</example>

### Phrasal verbs need a preposition or adverb

Phrasal verbs are verbs paired with one or more [prepositions](/node/130). They
can also go with an [adverb](/node/127). Check the dictionary entry for the verb
to use the correct combination.

<example>

#### Example

* We need to check in with each other. [The verb ‘check’ pairs with the prepositions ‘in’ and ‘with’.]
* They found out 6 breaches had occurred. [The verb ‘found’ goes with the adverb ‘out’.]</example>

When phrasal verbs need an object, you can put the object between the verb and
its other part.

<example>

#### Example

The clue gave away the answer. [The object, ‘the answer’, comes after both parts
of the phrasal verb, ‘gave away’.]The clue gave the answer away. [The object
comes between the first and second part of the phrasal verb.]</example>

## Author–date

The author–date system includes details for author and date in the text with a
full citation in a list of references. This system is suitable for most
Australian Government content.

### Include author and date in text, and list full details later

The author–date system uses:

* in-text citations with the author’s name and the date of publication
* an alphabetical reference list with the full information about the source.

People use the information from an in-text citation to find the corresponding
reference in the list.

The author–date system is useful when you have many sources to cite. It’s mostly
used in scientific writing and government reports, but you can use it for any
type of writing. It’s more accessible than the documentary–note system, as there
are no superscript numbers or symbols.

The referencing systems used by Harvard and the American Psychological
Association (APA) are examples of the author–date system. It’s also called the
name–year system.

#### Copyright requirements

You must properly attribute copyright material you cite or reference. This
includes text, images, video and sounds.

Include all the details required by open access licences (read how to [attribute
Creative
Commons](https://creativecommons.org.au/learn/fact-sheets/attribution/)).

Read the government copyright rules in the [Australian Government intellectual
property
manual](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

#### In-text citations

An in-text citation gives the author’s name and the date of publication. You can
put the author’s name as part of a sentence, or it can go in parentheses with
the date. Always include the date in parentheses. Don’t separate the name and
date with a comma.

<example>
* Jones (2017) reported similar results.
* Other results were similar (Jones 2017).</example>

Most in-text citations have only the author’s family name (or authoring
organisation’s name) and the year.

Use the shortened form of an organisation’s name in the in-text citation. (In
the reference list, you can use the shortened form followed by the spelt-out
form in parentheses.)

<example>
The ABC (2019) reported ...</example>

##### Two or more authors

For a work by 2 authors, include both names in the in-text citation.

<example>
Black and Jones (2017) reported similar results.</example>

For a work by 3 or more authors, use the first author’s name plus the Latin term
‘et al.’ (meaning ‘and others’). Don’t use italics for ‘et al.’. All authors’
names are included in the reference list.

<example>
Holmes et al. (2019) reported many changes.</example>

<example>
Other researchers reported similar results (Watson et al. 2017).</example>

Use the word ‘and’ between names outside and inside parentheses. Don’t use the
ampersand (‘&’).

<example>
Other researchers reported similar results (Black and Jones 2017).</example>

##### Page numbers

Include page numbers in the in-text citation only when the work has page numbers
and you’re including a direct quotation. Use a colon between the date and page
numbers.

<example>
* ‘These were identical results’ (White and Jones 2019:23–24).
* White and Jones (2019:23–24) claimed that these were ‘identical results’.</example>

##### Multiple works in one citation

When citing multiple works in the same in-text citation, use semicolons between
citations. Enclose all the citations in one set of parentheses.

<example>
Other researchers reported similar results (White and Jones 2017; Black 2018;
Abaza 2019).</example>

##### Multiple works by the same author in the same year

When citing multiple works by the same author in the same year, put a letter
after the date of each citation. Put an ‘a’ after the date of the first work you
cite, then a ‘b’ after the date of the second, and so on.

<example>
She has written extensively on Australia – New Zealand relations (Dobell 2018a,
2018b).</example>

##### Shortened forms and abbreviations of names

Use shortened forms and abbreviations in in-text citations to save space.

Use the same shortened form in the reference list, followed by the spelt-out
version. That way the user can easily find the reference but can also see the
organisation’s full name.

<example>
Australian trade with India expanded significantly in the second half of the
decade (DFAT 2018).</example>

##### No date of publication

For works without a date, write ‘n.d.’ (for ‘no date’) instead of the year of
publication.

<example>
* White and Jones (n.d.) reported similar results.
* Other researchers reported similar results (White and Jones n.d.).</example>

#### Reference lists

A reference list includes the full details of every cited work. Use the heading
‘References’.

On a webpage, place the reference list immediately after the content and under
the heading ‘References’. In print, place the reference list after any
appendices but before an index.

If the content has sections written by different authors or on different
subjects, include a reference list at the end of each section. This helps users
who are interested in only one section and keeps reference lists manageable.

Include a reference in your list for each source you cite in text. All other
sources can go in a list called ‘More reading’ or ‘More information’. This list
should appear after the reference list.

Some types of specialised sources, such as works of art, need their own
reference list. Others, like legislation, are only included in a reference list
if there are references to other types of works as well.

Check each type of specialised source that you’re using to see if you need to
include it in a reference list.

### Order the elements of each item in a reference list

References in the list will have different elements depending on the type of
source. For example, when citing a book, include the name of the publisher. When
citing a website, include the date you accessed it.

The general order is:

1. author or authoring organisation’s name
2. publishing date
3. title (and series or issue details)
4. publisher details
5. accessed date (for digital content).

Some elements have shortened forms used in referencing. Use the shortened form
when appropriate.

Follow the examples of author–date citations.

#### Personal author names

Write the family name of the authors, editors or translators before writing
their initials. Use the original spelling for all author names.

Don’t separate the family name from the initials with a comma. Don’t separate
initials with full stops.

<example>
Smith AB
</example>

#### Works by 2 or more authors

Unlike for in-text citations, include all of the authors’ names in a reference
list.

<example>
Jackson D, Li X and Chandran P (2018) ‘Safety and equity’, Psychological Science
Australia, 2(4):223–240.
</example>

#### Government names that have changed

Organisations change names over time. Use the name that appears on the source.

For example, the Services Australia annual report for 2016–17 has the author as
the Department of Human Services. That was the name of the agency at the time,
so use Department of Human Services as the author when you cite the report.

#### Shortened forms and abbreviations of organisations’ names

If you have used the shortened form of an organisation’s name in your content,
use it in your references. Use the shortened form followed by the spelt-out
version in parentheses.

Use the shortened form in subsequent references.

<example>
DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) (2018) [Fact sheets for countries
and regions –
India](https://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/resources/trade-and-economic-fact-sheets-for-countries-economies-and-regions),
DFAT, accessed 9 July 2021.
</example>

Only use a shortened form of an agency’s name if the agency uses it regularly.

For example, the Australian Public Service Commission regularly uses the
initialism ‘APSC’, so use it after the first mention and in the references.

Often, an organisation's name is both theauthor of the webpage and the name of
the website. To avoid repetition of long names, use the shortened form for the
name of the website after the title. Do this even if you have not introduced the
shortened form before.

<example>
Australian and New Zealand Spatial Information Council (n.d.) [Place
names](https://www.anzlic.gov.au/resources/foundation-spatial-data-framework/fsdf-themes-datasets/place-names),
ANZLIC website, accessed 5 December 2019.
</example>

#### Works without a date

For works without a date, write ‘n.d.’ instead of the date of publication.

<example>
* Lists should be clear (McMurrey n.d.) … [In-text citation]
* McMurrey DA (n.d.) [Online technical writing: lists](https://mcmassociates.io/textbook/lists.html), mcmassociates.io, accessed 30 September 2022. [Reference list item]</example>

#### Works that need the full date of publication

For works like newspaper articles and social media posts, include the full date
– not just the year – in the reference list. It makes it easier for users to
find this detail.

<example>
Richardson A (24 May 2018) ‘[Australia imports almost all of its oil, and there
are pitfalls all over the
globe](https://theconversation.com/australia-imports-almost-all-of-its-oil-and-there-are-pitfalls-all-over-the-globe-97070)’,
The Conversation, accessed 29 January 2020.
</example>

### Style and spell titles consistently

Use capitals, punctuation and italics consistently in all references.

Follow the rules in the examples of author–date citations, but generally:

* Capitalise all proper nouns, the names of periodicals and the first word of titles.
* Use lower case for all other words.
* Use commas to separate elements after the title.
* Use a full stop at the end of the reference.

Use italics for the [formal title of a complete published work](/node/187).

Don't use italics if the reference is:

* a book chapter
* an article
* a poem
* an episode
* a page that is part of a series or a similar division.

If it’s part of a publication, use single quotation marks around the title and
use italics for the name of the series, book or periodical.

<example>

#### Example

* Mackenzie J (2011) The editor’s companion, 2nd edn, Cambridge University Press, Melbourne. [The italicised title is for a complete published work.]
* Yik J (1 June 2017) ‘[Changing Australian medicine names](https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/changing-australian-medicine-names)’, Australian Prescriber, accessed 5 December 2019. [The reference is to a title for part of a publication (a periodical).]</example>

Use the original spelling for all titles and periodical names. This includes
retaining misspellings and American spelling variations.

<example>

#### Example

Bishop S and Back F (2020) ‘Organizational issues and color-coding’, Journal of
Pediatric Science, 4(2):22–25. [‘Organizational’ is an American spelling.]
</example>

### Hyperlink titles and include access dates for online works

Unless the source is behind a paywall, hyperlink the title of works available
online.

You don’t need to include the URL in references in digital content.

<example>

#### Example

DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) (2018) [Fact sheets for countries
and regions –
India](https://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/resources/trade-and-economic-fact-sheets-for-countries-economies-and-regions),
DFAT, accessed 9 July 2021.
</example>

Content publishers should make sure the [CSS print style
sheet](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss) automatically displays
the URLs from the hyperlinks when the content is printed. This might be a
default style in your document’s template.

If the document is print only, include a URL after the reference. Put the URL
after the final full stop.

<example>

#### Example

DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) (2018) Fact sheets for countries
and regions – India, DFAT, accessed 9 July 2021.
https://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/resources/trade-and-economic-fact-sheets-for-countries-economies-and-regions

[A print-only reference: the full hyperlink comes after the full stop, as the
title cannot be hyperlinked.]
</example>

Include the date you accessed the work. This is important because online sources
can change. The information you’re linking to could be different to what users
will find in the future.

#### PDFs

If you’re citing a PDF, avoid linking directly to the PDF. Instead link to the
landing page where the PDF is hosted.

Landing pages tend to be a more stable place to link to. PDFs are often renamed
or moved around a site. Linking to a PDF also requires the user to download
content.

<example>

##### Example

Thomson Reuters Australia (2017) ‘[Legislation and commentary table of
abbreviations](https://support.thomsonreuters.com.au/product/westlaw-au/articles/westlaw-au-guide-legislation-and-commentary-table-abbreviations)’
Westlaw AU Guides, Thomson Reuters Australia, accessed 6 April 2020.

[The link targets a landing page, not a PDF.]
</example>

If the PDF doesn’t have a landing page, link to the PDF and include ‘PDF’ in
square brackets after the title. Follow ‘PDF’ with the file size in kilobytes
(KB) or megabytes (MB). Include both of these additional details in the linked
text.

Cite the PDF with the details you can find in the document. Sometimes details
like publication dates will be missing.

<example>

##### Example

Thomson Reuters Australia (n.d.) [Table of abbreviations [PDF 94.35
KB]](https://support.thomsonreuters.com.au/sites/default/files/2017-09/AU-WLAU-Guide-Leg-Com-Table-of-Abbreviations.PDF),
Thomson Reuters Australia, accessed 20 January 2020.
</example>

#### Digital object identifiers (DOIs)

A DOI is a series of numbers and punctuation that identifies a document. Unlike
a URL, a DOI always stays the same. [DOIs are also internationally
standardised](https://www.doi.org/index.html).

Works that have DOIs include most journal articles, some e-books and some PDFs.

If the document has a DOI, include it in the citation in the reference list. Put
it at the end of the citation and include the shortened form ‘doi’ in lower case
before it.

<example>

##### Example

Kelleher T (2009) ‘Conversational voice’, Journal of Communication,
59(1):172–188, doi:10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.01410.x.
</example>

### Detail page, volume and issue numbers

If a citation has a volume number, an issue number and page numbers, follow the
format: volume(issue):page–page.

<example>

#### Example

Jackson D, Li X and Chandran P (2018) ‘Safety and equity’, Psychological Science
Australia, 2(4):223–240.
</example>

In this example, the work is from volume 2, issue 4, and it’s on pages 223 to
240.

### Alphabetise the reference items in the list

Order the reference list in alphabetical order, according to the family name and
given name of the lead author.

<example>
#### Example

* Jackson D, Li X and Chandran P (2018) ‘Safety and equity’, Psychological Science Australia, 2(4):223–240.
* Richardson A (24 May 2018) ‘[Australia imports almost all of its oil, and there are pitfalls all over the globe](https://theconversation.com/australia-imports-almost-all-of-its-oil-and-there-are-pitfalls-all-over-the-globe-97070)’, The Conversation, accessed 29 January 2020.</example>

#### Multiple works by the same author

If you have multiple works by the same writer, list them in date order.

</example>

For translated works, use the original author’s name in the in-text citation.

##### Place of publication of a book

Only include the place of publication if it’s relevant to the user.

The place of publication may be relevant if:

* you’re citing works with editions published in multiple locations
* the location the book was published impacts the credibility of your work.

Editions of books published in different locations may have different spelling
conventions. For example, the same publisher may publish an edition in London
(using UK spelling) and an edition in New York (using US spelling).

Sometimes knowing the place of publication of the sources adds credibility to
the work. For example, an Australian publication may be more credible if it
cites books published in Australia. Including the publishing location clearly
shows users where the book is from.

If the place of publication doesn’t add useful information for the user, you can
omit it from your citation.

<example>
###### Example

Oxford University Press (2016) New Oxford style manual, Oxford University Press.

## Broadcast media and podcasts (film, video, television and radio programs)

Cite film, television, radio and podcast programs so people can find the source
material. Use the right style and comply with copyright laws.

### Cite electronic media correctly

Electronic media include film, television, radio and podcasts. When you write
about electronic media you could also be referring to a script or a review.

Many of the general naming rules apply:

* Use sentence case – retain initial capitals for the first word, proper nouns and proper adjectives.
* Use italics for published works and roman type for unpublished works.
* Use roman type and quotation marks for parts of works, such as episodes.
* Use roman type and the spelling and capitalisation that the company uses for the names of channels, streaming services and networks.
* Use full names of organisations the first time you mention them.

Italicise the titles of films, television and radio programs, and podcasts.

Place the names of episodes in quotation marks and roman type.

Examples of in-text citations and reference lists on this page follow the
author–date system, as this is the most common way of citing film, television
and radio programs in government content.

#### Copyright requirements

You must attribute copyright material you reference. This includes video and
audio.

Include all the details required by open access licences (read how to [attribute
Creative
Commons](https://creativecommons.org.au/learn/fact-sheets/attribution/)).

Read the government copyright rules in the [Australian Government intellectual
property
manual](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

### Use italics and sentence case for film titles

Write the title as it appears in film information. Include punctuation marks and
any intentional misspelling. Italicise the title and use sentence case.

If the film is part of a series, include the number of the series in the same
format as in the original title of the film. For example, if the original title
has the number written as a word, use the word.

In-text citations of films often include the year of production. Place this
after the title in roman type and enclosed in parentheses.

If you mention the date in the text, you don’t have to include it in
parentheses.

<example>
* Ride like a girl (2019) tells the story of jockey Michelle Payne.
* Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) helped to revive the Australian film industry in the 1970s.
* Mad Max 2 (1981) was the second in the Mad Max series of films.
* They released The man from Snowy River II in 1988.</example>

After the first mention, you can abbreviate the title as long as it makes sense.
You can also omit the date in parentheses. This often happens with well-known
and longer titles because it improves the flow of the text.

<example>
Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) continues to be a popular film. Joan Lindsay wrote
the story that formed the basis for Picnic.</example>

#### Reference list entries for films

In a reference list, use the director and the year of release. Include the place
of production if known. If there is no credited director, use the name of the
producer.

Rule: Director D (director) or Producer P (producer) (Year) Title of film:
subtitle of film [motion picture], Name of Studio or Publisher, Place of
Production.

<example>
Seet S (director) (2019) Storm boy [motion picture], Ambience Entertainment,
Screen Australia, South Australian Film Corporation, Australia.

Safran H (director) (1976) Storm boy [motion picture], South Australian Film
Corporation, Australia.

Jury WF (producer) (1916) Battle of the Somme [motion picture], British Topical
Committee for War Films, London, UK.</example>

### Italicise television programs

Use sentence case, roman type and quotation marks for episodes of a program.

Use roman type and no quotation marks for the names of:

* production companies
* networks
* channels
* streaming services.

Include the year of production of television programs in roman type and
brackets.

<example>
* Gruen is a popular television program on ABC TV.
* The Australian story episode ‘Out of the blue’ is about a shark attack in the Whitsundays.
* Channel 7 has been screening cricket over the summer.
* One of the longest-running police dramas on Australian television was Homicide (1964–77).</example>

Use arabic – not roman – numerals for the numbers of seasons.

<example>
Season 2 of Offspring introduced the character of Dr Patrick Reid.</example>

#### Reference list entries for television programs

In a reference list, include the name of the director or producer and the year
of release. Include the place of production if known.

Rule: Director D (director) or Producer P (producer) (Year) ‘Title of episode:
subtitle of episode’ [television program], Name of series (season number,
episode number), Name of Station or Studio, Place of Production.

<example>
Pellizzeri R (director) (1994) ‘Luck of the draw’ [television program], Blue
heelers (season 1, episode 44), Seven Network, Melbourne.</example>

If the episode doesn’t have a name, write the name of the program first.

<example>
ABC Television (2019) Gardening Australia (season 30, episode 35) [television
program], ABC Television, Sydney.</example>

### Italicise radio programs and use roman type for episodes

To cite radio programs:

* Use italics for the titles of programs.
* Write the year of production in parentheses. Use roman type after the title.
* Enclose the names of individual episodes in single quotation marks and use roman type.
* Use sentence case.

<example>
* The wire is a news and current affairs program on Brisbane community radio station 4EB.
* Environmentalists will enjoy the radio program Off track on ABC Radio National.
* ‘The bilby, the moon and the Birriliburu Rangers’ from Off track went to air in
  January.
  One of the longest-running Australian radio programs was Blue hills (1949–76).</example>

#### Reference list entries for radio programs

In a reference list, include the full date the episode went to air. Include the
place of production if known.

Rule: Presenter P (presenter) (Day Month Year) ‘Title of episode: subtitle of
episode’ [radio program], Name of program, Name of Station or Studio, Place of
Production.

<example>
Jones A (presenter) (18 January 2020) ‘The bilby, the moon and the Birriliburu
Rangers’ [radio program], Off track, ABC Radio National, Sydney.</example>

### Italicise podcast series and use roman type for episodes

To cite podcasts:

* Use italics for the name of the program series.
* Use roman type and quotation marks for the names of individual podcast episodes.
* Use sentence case.

<example>
* A local podcast in this popular genre is Australian true crime, hosted by Meshel Laurie and Emily Webb.
* ‘Evil crows, bird funerals, swooping magpies’ is an episode from Triple J’s Science with Dr Karl podcast.
* Life’s little mysteries is a science podcast series produced by The Conversation.</example>

#### Reference list entries for podcasts

Hyperlink the episode’s title if you played it from a webpage. Don’t link to the
podcast’s file name. Always link to the webpage that hosts the podcast episode.
Include the date it was accessed at the end of the reference.

Rule: Host H (host) and Producer P (producer) (Day Month Year) ‘Title of
podcast: subtitle of podcast’ [podcast], Name of podcast, Name of Podcast
Network, accessed Day Month Year.

<example>

### Apply the same rules for script titles as for books

Published script titles follow the same rules as book titles:

* Use italics and sentence case for published script titles.
* Use roman type and quotation marks for unpublished script titles.

<example>

#### Example

* Peter Carey and Ray Lawrence co-wrote Bliss: the screenplay.
* University of Queensland Press published The big steal by David Parker in their screenplay series.
* ‘Cycle accident’ is in the university film script archives.</example>

#### Reference list entries for scripts

Reference the script as you would a book.

Rule: Author A (Year) Title of script: subtitle of script, Name of Publisher,
Place of Publication.

<example>

##### Example

Carey P and Lawrence R (1985) Bliss: the screenplay, University of Queensland
Press, St Lucia, Queensland.</example>

If you are referencing an online film script, hyperlink the title and include
the date you accessed it.

### Use roman type and quotation marks for review titles

Write titles of published reviews in roman type enclosed in single quotation
marks. Write the title of the reviewed material in italics and use sentence
case.

You may be able to hyperlink to the online review, depending on copyright
restrictions. If you access it online, include an accessed date.

<example>

#### Example

* David Stratton’s review of Bombshell, ‘Women put Fox on run’, contributed to the debate about the film.
* You can read David Knox’s review of The gloaming on TV Tonight.</example>

#### Reference list entries for reviews

If the name of the reviewed work appears in the title of the review, use italics
for the work name but roman type for the rest of the title.

Rule: Reviewer R (Day Month Year) ‘Title of review: subtitle of review’ [review
of Title of work by Creator], Name of Blog, Newspaper or Magazine, accessed Day
Month Year.

<example>

##### Example

* Buckmaster L (24 September 2019) ‘[Ride like a girl review – cinematic schmaltz swamps Michelle Payne’s ride to the Melbourne Cup](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/24/ride-like-a-girl-review-cinematic-schmaltz-swamps-michelle-paynes-ride-to-the-melbourne-cup)’ [review of Ride like a girl directed by Rachel Griffiths], The Guardian, accessed 19 January 2020.

## Classics

Classics are works from ancient and medieval times. Cite titles in line with the
author–date system. Use correct attribution to help people find the source in
its original language or as an English translation.

### Cite classics as book titles

Disciplines and sources define the term ‘classics’ in different ways. This
guidance covers ancient Greek and Roman works (until the 5th century) and works
from the medieval period (from the fall of the Roman empire until the middle of
the 15th century).

In references and in-text citations, treat the titles of classics as you would
other book titles.

* Use sentence case – capitalise only the first letter of the title and the first letter of any proper noun.
* Use italics for the titles of books, series and anthologies.
* Use quotation marks for the titles of chapters, poems or sections.

If you’re using a reference list, include any classics that you cite.

Examples of in-text citations and reference lists on this page follow the
author–date system, as this is the most common way of citing the classics in
government content. If your organisation uses the documentary–note system,
change the citation and style of reference list accordingly.

### Use correct in-text citations

Often there will not be much information for classics. For example, you might
not know the date of publication.

Include the information that you know in in-text citations.

If you don’t know the name of the author, don’t use ‘Anon’, ‘unknown’ or
‘Anonymous’ in the in-text citation.

<example> 
* Beowulf is the story of a hero who defeats a dragon.
* Like Grendel (Beowulf), you seem to suffer with the joy of others.
</example>

If you don’t know the author or the date of a work, use the name of the
translator (trans) and the date of publication of the edition you’re working
with. Place the date at the end of the reference.

<example> 
Beowulf (Heaney S, trans), Faber & Faber Ltd, London, 2002. [Reference-list
entry]

</example>

### Use common names for authors

Most authors of the classical and medieval periods are known just by a common
name, rather than a given name and a surname.

Use the author’s common name in text, in-text citations and reference lists.

As with other books, if you mention the author in the sentence, don’t place the
author’s name in brackets with the title of the work.

<example> 
As Cicero expressed it, ‘Is there anything rasher and more unworthy of the
dignity and strength of character of a wise man than the holding of a false
opinion?’ (On the nature of the gods)

</example>

### Include divisions in in-text citations when possible

Some classics have divisions. Divisions organise prose and poetry into, for
example, books, chapters, sections, lines and verses.

<example> 
* As one of the early philosophers wrote, ‘All wars are undertaken for the acquisition of wealth.’ (Plato Phaedo 65C–66E)
* He ended his retirement speech with Ovid’s ‘Turn loose the swans that drew my poet’s car.’ (The art of love 3.810)
* Josh hesitated at the doorway until, like Dante, he ‘went on, timid and full of thought’. (Dante The divine comedy 20.151) [In this example, Dante appears in the text as a character in The divine comedy and appears in the citation as author]
</example>

In the examples above:

* ‘65C–66E’ are section numbers
* ‘3.810’ means book 3, line 810
* ‘20.151’ means canto 20, line 151.

If the work you’re citing has divisions, quote them in the in-text citation. The
first time you cite a work, spell out the divisions. Place a comma between the
title of the work and the first division. Separate divisions with a comma.

<example> 
* (Ovid The art of love, book 3, line 810)
* Josh hesitated at the doorway until, like Dante, he ‘went on, timid and full of thought.’ (Dante The divine comedy, canto 20, line 151)
</example>

For subsequent citations, don’t spell out the divisions. You only need the
division numbers. Separate divisions with a full stop. Don’t place a comma
between the title of the work and the division numbers.

<example> 
* (Ovid The art of love 3.815)
* (Dante The divine comedy 20.151)
</example>

If you have only one division to cite, always spell it out. Place a comma
between the title and the division.

<example> 
Virgil and Dante argue over the value of pitying the sinners in their suffering.
(Dante The divine comedy, canto 20)

</example>

If you’re referring to an edition that doesn’t have divisions, you can refer to
specific page numbers. In these cases, place the date of the translation – or
edition – you’re working with and the page number after the title of the work.
Separate the date from the page numbers with a colon, not a full stop. Don’t use
spaces around the colon.

<example> 
* As one of the early philosophers wrote, ‘All wars are undertaken for the acquisition of wealth.’ (Plato Phaedo 1954:85)
* Josh hesitated at the doorway until, like Dante, he ‘went on, timid and full of thought.’ (The divine comedy 1954:265)
</example>

### Cite titles in the most appropriate language

Most of the time, you’ll be working with translations. The exception is when
you’re quoting text in the original language.

**Accessibility requirements**

If any text should be pronounced in its original language (rather than English),
screen readers need to be able to determine what that language is.

WCAG quick reference: [3.1.2 Language of parts – level
AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=312%2C131##language-of-parts)

#### Translated works

In in-text citations, refer to the English title that appears on the source
you’re citing. If you include the work in a reference list, use the date of the
translation and the name of the translator (‘trans’).

<example> 
 

* The heroism of women is a common motif in the stories of Hecuba, Andromache and Cassandra. (Euripides The Trojan women) [In-text citation]
* Euripides, [The Trojan women](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/35171/35171-h/35171-h.htm), (Murray G and Allen G, trans), London, 1905; Project Gutenberg, 2011, accessed 30 November 2019. [Reference-list entry: the date of the translation was 1905.]
</example>

#### Works in the original language

You will rarely need to cite works in the original language.

In these cases, cite the title in the original language. If the original
language uses a different alphabet to English – ancient Greek for example – use
the anglicised spelling.

<example> 
 

Troiades [The ancient Greek name for The Trojan women, a play by Euripides]

</example>

### List classics with other references

You don’t usually need a reference list for classics.

If you are using a reference list because you’re citing other works as well,
then include the classics you have cited.

If you include a classics work in the reference list, cite the particular
translation and edition you are working with. Make sure you:

* specify the date of the edition, not the date of the creation of the work
* acknowledge the translator (‘trans’)
* place the date at the end of the reference list entry – this is contrary to author–date style, but it stops possible confusion caused by, for example, ‘Plato (1954)’
* hyperlink titles in digital content where available.

<example> 
 

* Plato, Phaedo (Tredennick H, trans), Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1954.
* Dante, The divine comedy (Ruse HR, trans), Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York, 1954.
</example>

## Musical compositions

Cite musical compositions using the author–date system. Attribute compositions
with correct references to help people find a particular piece of music. 

### Cite musical compositions correctly

Musical compositions include:

* songs
* operas
* ballets
* dances
* chamber music
* soundtracks
* electronic music.

Information about musical compositions can include the:

* title
* common name
* type of composition
* composition’s key
* target instrument or instruments
* catalogue number.

You might use references for musical compositions in the program for official
events or other government-sponsored performances, or when using a soundtrack,
such as in a video.

The references must be accurate and complete so that they:

* provide all the information someone needs to identify the work properly
* comply with copyright and licensing laws.

Examples of in-text citations and reference lists on this page follow the
author–date system, as this is the most common way of citing musical
compositions in government content. If your organisation uses the
documentary–note system, change the citation and style of reference list
accordingly.

#### Copyright requirements

You must attribute copyright material you reference. This includes music and
audio, and any underlying copyright in the musical composition (for example,
lyrics or score).

Include all the details required by open access licences (read how to [attribute
Creative
Commons](https://creativecommons.org.au/learn/fact-sheets/attribution/)).

Read the government copyright rules in the [Australian Government intellectual
property
manual](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

#### Australian National Anthem

Use title case (maximal capitalisation) and quotation marks for Australia’s
National Anthem.

The Vice-Regal [Proclamation](https://www.legislation.gov.au/file/1984GN17) 1984
sets out the capitalisation of the National Anthem and ‘Advance Australia Fair’.

<example>
The crowd stood up to listen to the choir sing ‘Advance Australia Fair’.</example>

### Use roman type for unnamed compositions

For compositions with no given name, use roman type and no quotation marks.
Always use a capital letter for the key of musical compositions.

<example>
Telemann’s suite in D major, TWV 55:C6, was the first piece our chamber group
performed in public.</example>

For compositions numbered as one of a series, do not use a full stop for the
[contraction for the word numero (or
‘number’)](/node/191##only_use_the_contraction_no_with_numerals).

<example>
The radio was playing Elena Kats-Chernin’s piano concerto no 3.</example>

Don’t capitalise the generic type of composition.

<example>
* Vivaldi composed several concertos for strings; my favourite is Op. 12.
* Australian composer Carl Vine composed 6 string quartets between 1979 and 2017.</example>

Use the English word for most types of compositions (Table 1).

Table 1: English words for non-English names of compositionsPreferred English termNon-English termspreludepraeludiumfuguefugasymphony, symphoniessinfonia, sinfoniaeoratoriooratoriumsonglieder, chanson, canzonaduetduetto, duo[\*](##tnote)studyetude[\*](##tnote)\* Use the foreign terms if they are part of the title of the composition.

Use the English plural form for most types of compositions (Table 2).

Table 2: Plural forms for types of compositionsSingular formPlural formconcertoconcertos, concerti [grossi][\*](##tnote)suitesuitestriotriosariaariaspartitapartitastoccatatoccatassonatasonatascantatacantatas\* Use ‘concertos’, not ‘concerti’. The exception is ‘concerti grossi’, the name for a particular style of composition.

#### Catalogue numbers

Some composition names include the catalogue number.

‘Op.’ is the abbreviated form of the Latin ‘opus’, meaning ‘work’. It is a
common catalogue term for many composers' works. Always use a full stop with
this abbreviation.

Some of the more prolific composers have a catalogue of their own. For example,
‘BWV’ is the shortened form of the German Bach Werke Verzeichnis. The English
translation is ‘Bach works catalogue’.

Never spell out these shortened forms.

### Use italics for long works and compilations, roman type for songs

Style for the title of a composition depends on what version you are referring
to.

#### Songs and short pieces

Place the titles of songs or short, discrete pieces in single quotation marks.
Use sentence case.

<example>
The town meeting ended with the school children singing ‘The road to Gundagai’.

Justine Clarke became well known among Australian children for her 2005 song ‘I
like to sing’.</example>

Composition titles can be the name that the composer or producer gave the work
or they can be a popular name. The titles of hymns follow the same style.

<example>
Many people know Beethoven’s piano sonata no 14 ‘Quasi una fantasia’ as the
‘Moonlight sonata’.</example>

If a title is in another language, refer to it in the original language unless
it has an English title. Apply the capitalisation rules of the original
language.

<example>
Clara Schumann’s ‘Wenn ich ein Vöglein wär’ was arranged as a 3-part canon.</example>

Use the abbreviation ‘ft’ for artists named as featuring on song recordings.

<example>
Number 5 on Triple J’s Hottest 100 in 2014 was ‘Take me over’ by Peking Duk
ft SAFIA.</example>

#### Long works or series

Long works include operas, ballets and musicals. They may consist of a
collection of shorter pieces.

Use italics and sentence case for the titles of long works. If the title is in a
language other than English, refer to it in the original language. Apply the
capitalisation rules of that language.

<example>
* Many people know Australian tenor David Hobson from La bohème and The pirates of Penzance. Fewer people know that he is the composer of the chamber opera Remembering Rosie.
* The Brandenburg concertos are part of Bach’s collection of concertos (BWV 1046–1051).
* Eumeralla, a war requiem for peace, which was composed by the Australian soprano Deborah Cheetham, is sung in Gunditjmara language.</example>

#### Albums and compilations

Use italics and sentence case for the titles of albums, compilations, playlists
and collections. Use the same punctuation as the original title of the album or
compilation.

<example>
Stonefield is an Australian psych-rock outfit comprising 4 sisters from the
Macedon Ranges. Their second album, As above, so below, is their most popular
chart release so far.</example>

#### Soundtracks for films and video games

For names of the soundtracks of films and video games, use italics and sentence
case. For individual pieces in the soundtrack, use single quotation marks and
roman type.

<example>

##### Example

* Himesh Patel performed all songs in the soundtrack for Yesterday. The film features new versions of some of The Beatles’s greatest hits, like ‘Hey Jude’ and ‘Here comes the sun’.
* Halo original soundtrack is used in the game Halo: combat evolved.</example>

### Cite the song when you use someone’s lyrics

Write the name of the song, the author and the year of publication in
parentheses when you cite lyrics in a text.

If you mention the name of the song in the text, place only the author and the
year in parentheses. If you mention the author in text, put the date in
parentheses straight after the author’s name.

Use single quotation marks and sentence case for the name of the song.

<example>

#### Example

Kevin Parker sings, ‘If it calls you, embrace it / If it haunts you, face it’.
We can all learn from that (Tame Impala, ‘Lost in yesterday’ 2020).
</example>

### Include musical compositions if you’re using a reference list

In government content, you don’t need to create a reference list to cite musical
compositions. If you have a reference list already, add musical compositions to
your list.

If you’re writing another type of content, check whether you need to add musical
compositions to a reference list.

Rule: Creator C (Year) ‘Title of song: subtitle of song’ [Medium], Title of
compilation or album, Name of Publisher.

#### Example

* Tones and I (2019) ‘Dance monkey’ [Song], The kids are coming, Sony Music Australia.

Rule: Creator C (Year) Title of long work or compilation [Medium], Name of
Publisher.

## Plays and poetry

Cite plays and poetry using the author–date system. Attribute works with correct
references to help people find the play or poem.

### Cite plays and poems correctly

You might need to refer to plays and poetry in information about events, in
digital content and in other publications.

References to plays and poetry must be accurate and complete so that they:

* provide all the information someone needs to identify the work properly
* comply with copyright laws.

Examples of in-text citations and reference lists on this page follow the
author–date system, as this is the most common way of citing plays and poetry in
government content. If your organisation uses the documentary–note system,
change the citation and reference list styles accordingly.

#### Copyright requirements

You must attribute copyright material you reference. This includes plays, poems
and scripts.

Include all the details required by open access licences (read how to [attribute
Creative
Commons](https://creativecommons.org.au/learn/fact-sheets/attribution/)).

Read the government copyright rules in the [Australian Government intellectual
property
manual](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

### Reference play titles and quotes from plays

Style for play titles follows the same convention as for books but is based on
details about the published edition. Quoted material from plays has distinct
punctuation and formatting.

#### Use italics and sentence case for titles of plays

Write titles of plays in italics and use sentence case. This means the first
word and any proper nouns have an initial capital letter.

<example>
* The theme of Williamson’s Emerald city is in stark contrast to that of The club.
* Noni Hazlehurst played Kathy in the Sydney Theatre Company’s play No names … no pack drill.</example>

#### Use a forward slash to show line breaks in plays

When you quote lines spoken by a character in a play, use a forward slash to
show line breaks appearing in the original. Insert spaces around the forward
slash. If there's a line break in your text, it can occur before or after the
slash.

<example>
Adita loved to quote Hamlet on days like this. ‘Tis now the very witching time
of night / When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out / Contagion to
this world …’ Her colleagues found these performances tiresome.</example>

#### Don’t use quotation marks in scripts of plays

In plays, you don’t need quotation marks if the direct speech follows the name
of the speaker.

<example>
* RICHARDS: You’ve the luck of the devil.
* NED: It’s not luck; it’s gumption. We don’t think with our boots as traps do.</example>

#### Use divisions for in-text citations of plays

Citations to plays are more helpful if you use divisions – acts, scenes and
lines. Readers who wish to read the quote in context can use the divisions to
find it in any edition of the play.

Use the full name of the playwright, unless people can identify the playwright
by the surname. Use roman type (not italics), lower case and numerals for
divisions.

<example>
In the words of Breaker Morant, ‘There are things adrift here … alien to
justice.’ (Kenneth Ross Breaker Morant, act 1, scene 13)</example>

Ancient and medieval dramatic works have specific citation rules: refer to
[classics](/node/172).

#### Include plays if you’re using a reference list

In government content, you don’t need to create a reference list just to cite
plays. If you have a reference list already, then add plays to your list. You
can also add reviews of plays to the list.

##### Citing plays

Use the edition of the play you cited. If the play was written well before the
edition, place the original date in parentheses with the edition’s publishing
date.

Rule: Author A (Year of Original Publication/Year of Edition) Title of play:
subtitle of play, Name of Publisher of Edition, Place of Publication.

<example>
* Murray-Smith J (2002) Rapture, Currency Press, Sydney.
* Ross K (1979) Breaker Morant: a play in two acts, Edward Arnold Pty Ltd, Melbourne.
* Yeats WB (1892/2018) The Countess Cathleen: a play, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, Scotts Valley.</example>

Use the author–date system for in-text citations in documents with a reference
list. Include a page number after a colon if you’re citing a specific page. Use
the original and edition dates if citing an old work.

<example>
* (Murray-Smith 2002:5)
* (Ross 1979:15)
* (Yeats 1892/2018)</example>

##### Citing reviews of plays

Follow the rules of citation for the source (for example, a newspaper) that
published the review. Use italics for the title of the play.

Rule: Reviewer R (Day Month Year) ‘Title of review: subtitle of review’ [Review
of Title of work by Creator], Name of Blog, Newspaper or Magazine, accessed Day
Month Year.

<example>
* Wilkins P (5 April 2019) ‘How to rule the world a timely reminder of issues facing the nation’ [Review of How to rule the world by Nakkiah Lui], The Canberra Times.
* Wakelin O (25 January 2019) ‘Review: The big time, Ensemble Theatre’ [Review of The big time by David Williamson], ArtsHub, accessed 18 December 2019.</example>

### Reference poem titles and parts of poems

Style for references to poem titles depends on how the poem was published. Refer
to parts of poems using the right kind of punctuation.

#### Use quotation marks for titles of poems

Enclose titles of poems in quotation marks. If the title is part of a quotation,
enclose it in double quotation marks.

<example>
* MJ decided his draft was ‘huddled in clichés’ like the writer’s words in Gwen Harwood’s poem ‘Critic’s nightwatch’.
* Melanie Mununggurr-Williams’s performance of ‘I run …’ is available to watch on YouTube.
* ‘Have you read “Sun orchids” by Douglas Stewart?’ asked Hayley.</example>

#### Italicise titles of poems published as books

Poems can be published as a freestanding work in book form. In this case, follow
the citation rules for books. Use italics for the poem’s title.

This means you italicise the titles of verse novels as you do for prose novels.

<example>
* Sky saga: a story of Empire airmen by Thomas White is a tribute to the men of the Empire Air Training Scheme.
* Les Murray wrote Fredy Neptune: a novel in verse in 8-line stanzas.</example>

#### Capitalise and punctuate the title of a poem as the author does

A poem’s title is part of its artistic integrity. Apply the author’s own style
for capitalisation and punctuation. If the title is all lower case or all upper
case, follow suit.

If you’re unsure of the author’s style, write the titles of poems using sentence
case. Sentence case can usually replace title case (maximal capitalisation),
which is often a publishing style rather than an artistic choice.

<example>
* Sue Nicholls’s anthology includes ‘The Moment’, ‘those black sunglasses’ and ‘Joan (ii)’.
* George Ade’s poem ‘R-E-M-O-R-S-E’ begins with the lines, ‘The cocktail is a pleasant drink, / It’s mild and harmless, I don’t think.’</example>

#### Italicise titles of filmpoems

Filmpoems are a combination of images and poetry (spoken or written) watched on
a screen. Filmpoems also include people reciting poetry onscreen. Sometimes
filmpoems have other names, such as ‘poetryfilms’, ‘videopoems’ or ‘screen
poetry’.

Italicise titles of filmpoems and use the original capitalisation and
punctuation.

<example>

##### Example

The videopoem Dog Daze is the work of Adelaide poet and former anatomy
professor Ian Gibbons.</example>

#### Use the first lines of untitled, published poems

Some poems do not have titles. They often become known by their first line and
are usually cited that way. Even if the poem isn’t well known, use the first
line as a title for untitled poems. The aim is to give readers enough
information to find the poem.

Use quotation marks as you would for other titles. Capitalise the line as it
appears in the poem.

<example>

##### Example

* Birmingham included his sonnet ‘I am very bothered when I think’ in the collection titled Paper aeroplane: selected poems 1989–2014.
* Arthur Buller wrote ‘There was a young lady from Bright’, a limerick about relativity.</example>

#### Describe untitled, unpublished spoken word poems

The nature of spoken word and performance poetry means the text often isn’t
published. Give people enough information to appreciate and identify the poem.
It’s possible a performance was recorded. To help people find it online, name
the poet and the event, or quote some of the poet’s words.

<example>

##### Example

* Arielle Cottingham’s performance at the 2016 Australian Poetry Slam began with the words, ‘History is an ocean’.
* Zaynab Farah’s mother is at the centre of her poem, which explores the ‘why’ of society’s response to difference. She performed it at the 2019 Australian Poetry Slam.</example>

#### Use italics for titles of anthologies and other collections

If a poem is part of a published collection, italicise the title of the
collection and use sentence case. Use quotation marks for the poems in the
collection.

<example>

##### Example

‘(Because I am a daughter) of diaspora’ appeared in Eunice Andrada’s collection
Flood damages.</example>

#### Use a forward slash to show line breaks in poems

Separate lines of poetry in a sentence with a forward slash. Insert spaces
around the forward slash. If there's a line break in your text, it can occur
before or after the slash.

<example>

##### Example

Challenged to quote some Slessor, Rita responded in a flash, ‘In Melbourne, your
appetite had gone, / Your angers too; ...’</example>

#### Use in-text citations for quotations from poems

In government writing, mentioning the poet and the title of the poem is usually
enough.

Always cite quotations in text. Follow the quotation with the poet’s name in
roman type and the title of the poem in quotation marks. Use the poet’s full
name, unless people can identify the poet by the surname alone.

<example>

##### Example

* As David Malouf wrote in ‘As Living Is’, ‘As living is / or Life as we call it / Neither perfect / nor plain …’
* The poet wrote ‘… There was enough space, enough / suddenness, as if everything might stay in reach.’ (Martin Harrison ‘Tasmania’)</example>

#### Use divisions if they are available

Use lower case and numerals for divisions.

Divisions are cantos, verses, stanzas and lines marked and numbered on the text
of some longer, older poems. Divisions are the same for all editions of these
poems. This means that people who want to read a quotation in context can use
divisions to find the quotation in any edition.

If a poem does not have divisions, use a reputable online version and hyperlink
the poem’s title. Users can then search to find the cited lines on the webpage.

<example>

##### Example

Here are 2 of the most famous – and misquoted – lines in poetry. ‘Water, water,
every where, / Nor any drop to drink.’ (Coleridge The Rime of the Ancient
Mariner, part 2, verse 29, lines 121–2).</example>

For subsequent citations, you can use just use the division numbers, without the
words ‘part’, ‘verse’ or ‘lines’.

Hyperlinked citations are an option for digital content.

<example>

##### Example

* (Coleridge The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, 2.29.121–2)
* (Coleridge [The Rime of the Ancient Mariner](https://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poems/rime-ancient-mariner-text-1834))</example>

#### Include poems if you’re using a reference list

You don’t need to create a separate reference list to cite poems, but if you
have a reference list already, then add poems to your list.

Use the edition of the poem you cited. If the poem was written well before the
edition, place the original date in parentheses with the edition’s publishing
date.

Rule: Author A (Year of Original Publication/Year of Edition) ‘Title of poem:
subtitle of poem’, Name of collection, Name of Publisher of Edition, Place of
Publication.

As in text, use the original capitalisation of the poem in the reference list
entry.

<example>
##### Example

* Poe EA (1845/2012) The raven, Arcturus Publishing Limited, London. [Old poem]
* Harrison M (2008) Wild bees, University of Western Australia Press, Crawley. [Book of poetry]
* Taylor A (1982) ‘The cool change’, Selected poems, University of Queensland Press, St Lucia. [Poem in a book]
* Grono W (1973) ‘A Postcard from Perth’, in Hewett D (ed.), Sandgropers: a Western Australian anthology, University of Western Australia Press, Nedlands. [Poem in an edited book]
* Dong-Jip Shin (1974) ‘Ordinary autumn evening’, Best loved poems of Korea, (Ko Ch’ang-su, trans.), Hollym International, Republic of Korea. [Translated poem in a book]
* White TW (1944) Sky saga: a story of empire airmen, 2nd edn, Hutchinson & Co., Melbourne. [Long poem]
* Harwood G (1963) ‘[Critic’s nightwatch](https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/critic-s-nightwatch/)’, Poems, Poem Hunter website, accessed 18 December 2019. [Poem on a website]</example>

Use the author–date system for in-text citations in documents with a reference
list. Include a page number after a colon if you’re citing a specific page. Use
the original and edition dates if citing an old work.

<example>
##### Example

* (Poe 1845/2012)
* (Harrison 2008:133)
* (Grono 1973)
* (Dong-Jip Shin 1974:133)
* (White 1944)</example>

### Cite Shakespeare’s poetry correctly

William Shakespeare wrote 154 sonnets and other poetry. Sometimes people cite
the songs from Shakespearean plays as verse.

Each sonnet has a number (not a title). The number is a division number that
remains the same across editions. To cite the sonnets use either:

* Sonnet X
* the first line in quotation marks, as for other untitled poems.

<example>
#### Example

* Shakespeare’s Sonnet 116 contains lines often read during marriage ceremonies ‘… love is not love / Which alters when it alteration finds, / Or bends with the remover to remove.’
* Shakespeare’s ‘Let me not to the marriage of two minds’ is a popular reading at wedding ceremonies.</example>

Use italics for Venus and Adonis and The rape of Lucrece. They are available as
freestanding publications.

Use quotation marks for Shakespeare’s other poetic works.

<example>
#### Example

* ‘A lover’s complaint’ is Shakespeare’s shortest narrative poem.
* Portia’s musicians sing ‘Tell me where is fancy bred’ (Shakespeare The merchant of Venice, 3.2.63–72).</example>

### Treat nursery rhymes, fairy tales and fables like books

If a nursery rhyme, fairy tale or fable is published individually as a book or
dramatic work, use italics for the title.

If they are part of a collection, use italics for the collection but quotation
marks for individual works. Treat individual works as you would a chapter in a
book.

Use sentence case.

<example>
#### Example

* The country cousin is a 1936 Disney animated film based on Æsop’s fable ‘The town mouse and the country mouse’.
* Children like the pictures in The Australian fairy tale of the three koala bears and little Goldilocks.
* Maurice Sendak illustrated the Grimms’ tale The juniper tree.
* ‘Toast for Tommy’ was first published in Thomas Gunn’s Bush nursery rhymes in 1920.</example>

For direct quotes, include the author and date, if known. If the date isn’t
known, use the title. Use ‘Anon’ if the author is unknown.

<example>
#### Example

* Ashley said she felt like those lizards in a nursery rhyme who’d had their tails removed by ‘a cunning fish’ (Anon. ‘Three lizards went down to a water pool’).
* Among other lessons, Æsop’s fables teach us that ‘it is easy to despise what you cannot get’ (Æsop ‘The fox and the grapes’).</example>

## Works of art

Cite works of art using the author–date system. Attribute artwork with correct
references to help people find the source and relevant information.

### Cite works of art correctly

Works of art include:

* paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures and ceramics
* other physical artworks such as street and neon sign art
* ephemeral and performance artwork
* antiquities – objects from ancient times such as coins and pottery
* posters, maps, clip art, photographs and cartoons
* digital art – art created using technology such as video, computer or laser beam.

You might need to reference works of art for exhibitions and programs or when
using decorative images in digital content. The reference must:

* provide all the information someone needs to identify the work properly
* comply with copyright laws.

Examples of in-text citations and reference lists on this page follow the
author–date system, as this is the most common way of citing works of art in
government content.

#### Copyright requirements

You must attribute copyright material you reference. This includes images and
works of art.

Include all the details required by open access licences (read how to [attribute
Creative
Commons](https://creativecommons.org.au/learn/fact-sheets/attribution/)).

Read the government copyright rules in the [Australian Government intellectual
property
manual](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

#### Prioritise accessibility

Images, including works of art, may be inaccessible to:

* people who have low vision
* people who use screen readers to access content
* users of mobile phones.

When including images of art in content, ensure they:

* are sized for easier viewing
* will display correctly on mobile phones or other small screen devices
* can be made larger by people, without loss of content or functionality
* include alt text so that descriptions of the image can be read by screen readers or mobile users wishing to limit data usage.

Use of the author–date system also improves accessibility. It places references
within the main text so there is no need for superscript reference markers. This
helps make references readable for screen readers and more accessible to mobile
users.

##### Accessibility requirements

Only include images on a page if they meet a real user need.

Prepare short [alt text for images](/node/49) and describe the relevant features
of the work of art in the discussion to explain the relevance of the image.

WCAG quick reference: [Non-text content – level
A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##non-text-content)

### Use italics and sentence case for artwork titles

Italicise the titles of individual artworks and use sentence case.

Sometimes the artist has made a different typographic choice for the title. If
so, follow the capitalisation of the original. Include any numbers or
punctuation in exactly the same way as the artist does.

From the second mention, you can use a shortened version of the name if it makes
sense.

If the title is in another language, write it in that language. Use the exact
spelling. You can include the English translation of the title.

<example>
* Margaret Olley’s Portrait in the mirror is one of her notable works. Portrait is usually included in retrospectives of Olley’s work.
* Parliament’s forecourt mosaic is based on Michael Nelson Jagamara’s Possum and Wallaby Dreaming.
* Robinson won the Wynne Prize for Creation landscape – earth and sea. Creation is a stunning example of Robinson’s understanding of light.
* William Yaxley used mandarin peel in his sculpture, The mangrove monster no. 2.
* Bessie Davidson's Fleurs (flowers), completed in 1942, was sold in 2017.</example>

#### Other titles of artworks

Sometimes people call works of art by a name other than that given to them by
the artist. Italicise the informal names of artworks in the same way that you
would with the formal titles.

<example>
Jackson Pollock titled his 1952 work Number 11 before it became known as Blue
poles in a 1954 exhibition.</example>

#### Untitled works

Sometimes an artist may choose to call a work ‘Untitled’ or not give it a name.
Write ‘Untitled’ in italics with an initial capital letter. Include the year of
production and the artist’s name.

You might not be able to find the year of production. In this case, include the
artist’s name and the medium of the work in square brackets.

<example>
* Hunter’s Untitled (1968) is part of the permanent collection in the Museum of Contemporary Art.
* Dinh’s Untitled [oil on hardboard] was recently purchased for a private collection.</example>

### Use title case and italics for artwork series

An individual artwork is sometimes part of a series. Write the titles of series
of unique works of art in italics. Use title case (maximal capitalisation).
Write the titles of the individual works of art in the series in italics, too.
Capitalise and punctuate according to the original title.

<example>
* The exhibition included Coffin with flowers and potter’s wheel with landscape decoration, a drawing in the Potter series by Arthur Boyd.
* Sidney Nolan’s Ned Kelly series is currently touring Australia. Ned’s sister Margaret features in one of the works, Quilting the armour, painted in 1947.</example>

Modern works in a series might not use capital letters at all.

<example>
flight research ##6 is part of Rosemary Laing’s Flight Research series.</example>

### Use the details you have to cite ephemeral and performance art

Ephemeral and performance art can be difficult to cite. The key points to
remember are:

* Use the artwork’s correct name in use at a particular time.
* Follow style rules for titles and series. For example, write the title as the artist has and use italics for published works.
* Include context and details about the artwork to help people understand the work.

<example>
Wrapped Coast, One Million Square Feet, Little Bay, Sydney, Australia was a work
undertaken by artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude in 1968 and 1969. They used
erosion-control fabric and polypropylene rope to wrap the coastline of Little
Bay, where it remained for 10 weeks. Originally called Packed Coast, sale of
preparatory drawings funded the project.</example>

It’s important to include detailed information because:

* changing technology blurs the line between art forms and results in new art forms
* art forms change name and format
* the phrase ‘work of art’ includes the use of social media by the artist to discuss the artwork
* the term ‘art’ may extend to and include the discussion of a work of art on social media.

### Use roman type for exhibition titles

Write the titles of exhibitions in roman type and use the same capitalisation as
the museum or gallery uses.

<example>
* Cai Guo-Qiang’s Heritage (2013) is part of GOMA’s Water exhibition.
* The Asia Pacific Triennial attracts visitors from all over Australia.</example>

#### Use italics for titles of exhibition catalogues

The titles of exhibition catalogues usually have the same name as the
exhibition.

Treat catalogues as books. Write catalogue titles in italics and use sentence
case for the title.

<example>
The Philip Bacon Galleries produced a catalogue named Important Australian
paintings. It accompanied the 2011 exhibition of the same name. [The exhibition
name is ‘Important Australian Paintings’.]</example>

#### Exhibition catalogues in a reference list

Include the name of the exhibition and the format of the catalogue in the
reference list. After the title of the exhibition, include the full start and
end dates for the exhibition.

Rule: Author or Gallery Name (Year) Title of exhibition [format], Day Month Year
of exhibition, Publisher, Location of Gallery.

<example>
Philip Bacon Gallery (2011) Important Australian paintings [printed exhibition
catalogue], 31 May to 25 June 2011, Philip Bacon Galleries, Brisbane.</example>

For online catalogues, hyperlink the title of the catalogue and include an
accessed date. If the catalogue is a PDF, link to the page where the PDF is
hosted, instead of to the PDF. If you can’t link to a host page, include ‘PDF’
in square brackets after the format information.

Rule: Author or Gallery Name (Year) Title of exhibition [format] [PDF], Day
Month Year of exhibition, Publisher, Place, accessed Day Month Year.

<example>
Campbell H (2010) [Colour, rhythm, design: wood & lino cuts of the 20s and
30s](https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/education/online-catalogues/colour-rhythm-design/)
[online exhibition catalogue], 13 March to 11 July 2010, Art Gallery of NSW,
Sydney, accessed 23 February 2020.</example>

### Include artwork details in captions

Websites, catalogues, brochures and books often include details of artworks. The
style and details may vary depending on the publication and context. Use common
abbreviations where possible, and be consistent.

#### Captions with images of artworks in digital content

If your content features an image of an artwork, it must accompanied by a
[caption](/node/49) with:

* the full details of the work of art
* copyright and permission information, if necessary.

Rule: Creator Full Name (Year) Title or description of work [medium], Website,
Exhibition or Gallery, Location of Gallery, © Creator, courtesy: Creator or
Gallery, accessed Date Month Year.

<example>

##### Example

* Megan Cope (1982) Quandamooka people [hand-cast concrete oyster shells, copper slag, foam support structure], RE FORMATION 2019, Australia, © and image courtesy: Megan Cope.
* Angela Tiatia (2015) Holding on [still], Sullivan + Strumpf Gallery, Sydney, © Angela Tiatia, courtesy: Sullivan + Strumpf Gallery.</example>

#### Captions for artworks in collections, exhibitions and catalogues

Captions appear as labels beside artworks that are hung in exhibitions and
collections. They also support images of artworks in exhibition catalogues. The
caption includes specific information about the work and the artist as well as
the name of the museum or gallery.

For each collection, exhibition or catalogue, use either a long or short caption
style and use that style consistently. If it’s a solo exhibition, don’t include
the artist’s name on each artwork.

Write long captions in this order:

* artist
* title of artwork
* year of creation of the artwork
* medium
* size
* name of museum/gallery
* date of acquisition
* location of museum/gallery
* whether the work is part of a bequest.

<example>

##### Example

* Sidney NolanSnake (Rainbow Serpent), 1970–729.14 x 45.72 metres, ink, dye, and wax crayon on cardMuseum of Old and New Art, Hobart, Tasmania© The Trustees of the Sidney Nolan Trust
* Eveline Kotai3 x 3 x 3, 1998–99Susanne Castleden, printerstencilartist’s proof, published stateedition of 39; plus artist’s proofssheet 27.0 (h) x 27.0 (w) cmNational Gallery of Australia, CanberraGordon Darling Australasian Print Fund</example>

Write short captions in this order:

* artist
* year of creation of the artwork
* title of artwork
* medium
* name of museum/gallery
* location of museum/gallery.

<example>

##### Example

* Nolan S (1970–1972)Snake (Rainbow Serpent)wall paintingMuseum of Old and New Art, Hobart
* Kotai E (1998–1999)3 x 3 x 3stencil printNational Gallery of Australia, Canberra</example>

### Mention the name of the museum or gallery in text

When you write about artwork, include the name of the institution that holds the
work in its collection.

<example>

#### Example

The Sydney Nolan Gallery in MONA houses Snake, a 46-metre artwork by Sydney
Nolan.</example>

### List artworks after the main reference list

For in-text citations, include the artist, year of creation and title of the
artwork in parentheses. Depending on the type of publication, you might include
other details (such as the medium or format).

Include the full source information in a list of artworks after the reference
list.

Rule: Creator C (Year) Title or description of work [medium], Website,
Exhibition or Gallery, Location of Gallery, accessed Date Month Year.

<example>

#### Example

* The collection includes Long (The spirit of the plains 1897). [In-text citation]
* Long S (1897) The spirit of the plains [painting], Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane, Australia. [Reference list entry]</example>

## Documentary–note

The documentary–note system uses a symbol or number in the text to mark detailed
references in footnotes or endnotes. Choose this system only if it best suits
the mode of publishing content and user needs.

### Place a reference marker in text, link it to details in a note

The documentary–note system uses:

* superscript reference markers – numbers or symbols – in the text
* footnotes or endnotes with the full information about the source.

Each note has the corresponding superscript reference marker before it. Users
find the note by matching the number or symbol. In digital content, the
reference markers can be hyperlinked to help users access the note.

<example>
Other researchers reported similar results.1 [In-text citation]

1 AB Smith, ‘Abbreviations in scientific content’, Scientific Communication
Studies, 2019, 23(4):1–12. [The corresponding note]</example>

#### Accessibility requirements

Reference markers and footnotes can be inaccessible to:

* people who have low vision
* people who use screen readers to access content
* users of mobile phones.

If using reference markers and footnotes, ensure they:

* are sized for easier readability
* will display correctly on mobile phones or other small screen devices
* can be made larger by users without loss of content or functionality
* can be read by screen readers.

Seek specialist advice to ensure you achieve this functionality.

You can also [increase accessibility by using the author–date
system](/node/165), which places references within the main text and uses fewer
symbols.

Use notes for the sources you cite in the text. All other sources can be listed
in a section called ‘More reading’ or ‘More information’. This list should
appear at the end of a page of digital content, or at the end of a section in
print.

#### Copyright requirements

You must attribute copyright material you reference. This includes text, images,
video and sounds.

Include all the details required by open access licences (read how to [attribute
Creative
Commons](https://creativecommons.org.au/learn/fact-sheets/attribution/)).

Read the government copyright rules in the [Australian Government intellectual
property
manual](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

#### Footnotes and endnotes

Footnotes are at the end of a page. Endnotes are at the end of a section,
chapter or document.

Use the heading ‘Notes’ for footnotes in digital content and for endnotes. Don’t
use a heading for footnotes in print-only publications.

##### Footnotes

Footnotes are preferable for digital content, which has no set page length. The
user can find the source information on the page they’re accessing.

In print, footnotes work well if you only have a few citations. If you have many
citations, the footnote section at the bottom of the page can become quite long.
This leaves you with little space on the page for content.

##### Endnotes

Endnotes work better for print, which has a set page length, because they don’t
take up space on a page.

In print, if you have sections written by different authors or on different
subjects, include a list of endnotes at the end of each section. This helps
users who are only interested in one section and keeps lists of notes
manageable.

### Use numbers for reference markers in most content

Use reference numbers instead of symbols in most content. Numbers are easier for
users to match and they’re in an intuitive sequence.

In content that uses a lot of citations, restart numbering on each page of
digital content or in each section of a document.

#### Symbols

Reference symbols are best for content with many numbers, such as content with
mathematical equations.

Use symbols if there’s a risk that users will confuse superscript numbers for
exponents.

<example>
2x2 − 2x + 12 = 16\*</example>

Reference symbols can be especially difficult for screen readers to read or link
to.

Symbols can affect readability unless a user changes default settings (verbosity
settings). By default, screen readers won’t necessarily read the symbols by
their names – for example, ‘asterisk’ can be announced as ‘star’. This can
affect people’s ability to quickly understand the reference markers.

If this will be an issue for your users, especially in digital content, use the
author–date system instead.

##### Footnotes and symbols

If you use symbols, use footnotes instead of endnotes. It’s easier for users to
match symbols if they’re closer together.

##### Order of reference symbols

Use the symbols in this order:

* \* (asterisk)
* † (dagger)
* ‡ (double dagger)
* § (section sign)
* ## (hash sign).

Restart the symbols on each page. If you have more than five notes on a page,
double the symbols (\*\*, ††).

### Put reference markers in the right place

Putting reference markers in the right place helps users find references without
interrupting their reading.

In digital content, hyperlink the reference marker to help users access the
note.

#### Reference markers for in-text citations

Place reference markers immediately after quoted material, or after phrases,
clauses or sentences. Don’t interrupt a phrase or clause with a reference
marker.

<example>
Other researchers reported similar results.1</example>

Place reference markers after commas and other sentence punctuation.

<example>
Other researchers reported similar results.1</example>

#### Reference markers for endnotes and footnotes

Place reference markers before the footnote or endnote. Add a single space
between the reference marker and the beginning of the reference.

<example>
4 AB Smith, CD Jones and EF Baker, ‘The new science of widgetry’, Theoretical
Studies, 2019, 23(4):121–132.</example>

#### More than one reference marker

Don’t use more than one reference marker in the same place, such as when citing
2 works. Instead cite both works in one footnote or endnote, separating the
entries in the note with a semicolon.

<example>
Other researchers reported similar results.1 [In-text citation]

1 AB Smith, CD Jones and EF Baker, ‘The new science of widgetry’, Theoretical
Studies, 2019, 23(4):121–132; D Jackson, X Li and P Chandran, ‘Safety and
equity’, Psychological Science Australia, 2018, 2(3):223–240.

[The note runs 2 citations together using same reference marker.]</example>

### Order the elements of each reference in a note

Format all notes consistently to help users find the source.

#### Elements in a note

Citations in notes will have different elements depending on the type of source.
For example, when citing a book, include the name of the publisher. When citing
a website, include the date you accessed it.

The general order is:

1. author or authoring organisation’s name
2. title
3. publisher
4. publishing date
5. accessed date (for digital content).

If you cite the same work more than once, give it its own reference marker. In
the notes, use a shortened form of the citation after the first mention, instead
of citing the full source again.

Short forms include only the author’s family name (or authoring organisation
name) and the title of the source.

If you’re using endnotes at the end of each section, use the long form of the
reference note the first time you cite the work in that section.

Some elements have [shortened forms used in referencing](/node/92). Use the
shortened form when appropriate.

Don’t use the Latin abbreviations ‘ibid.’, ‘op cit.’ or ‘loc cit.’ for repeated
citations.

Follow the examples of documentary–note citations.

#### Personal author names

Write the initials of given names before writing the family name of the authors,
editors or translators. Use the original spelling for all author names.

Don’t separate initials with full stops.

<example>
AB Smith</example>

Short citations include only the author’s name and the title. Don’t include
initials in short citations.

<example>
D Eades, Aboriginal ways of using English, Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra,
2013. [Full citation]

Eades, Aboriginal ways of using English. [Short citation]</example>

##### More than 2 authors

Shortened forms include up to 2 author family names. When you have more than 2
authors, use the Latin term ‘et al.’ (meaning ‘and others’) in short citations.
Don’t use italics for ‘et al.’.

<example>
T Kelleher, M Edmunds and L Ormston, ‘Conversational voice’, Journal of
Communication, 2009, 59(1):172–188, doi:10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.01410.x. [Full
citation]

Kelleher et al., ‘Conversational voice’. [Short citation]
</example>

#### Organisation as author

If the author is an organisation, short citations use the shortened form of the
organisation’s name.

The first note to cite the organisation as author gives the name in full, and
introduces the shortened form.

<example>
Oxford University Press (OUP), New Oxford style manual, Oxford University Press,
Oxford, 2016. [Full citation]

OUP, New Oxford style manual. [Short citation]
</example>

##### Government names that have changed

Organisations change names over time. Use the name that appears on the source.

For example, the Services Australia annual report for 2016–17 has the author as
the Department of Human Services. That was the name of the agency at the time,
so use Department of Human Services as the author when you cite the report.

##### Shortened forms and abbreviations of organisations’ names

If you have used the shortened form of an organisation’s name in your content,
use it in your references. Use the shortened form followed by the spelt-out
version in parentheses.

Use the shortened form in subsequent references.

<example>
DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade), [Fact sheets for countries and
regions –
India](https://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/resources/trade-and-economic-fact-sheets-for-countries-economies-and-regions),
DFAT, 2018, accessed 9 July 2021.
</example>

Only use a shortened form of an agency’s name if the agency uses it regularly.

For example, the Australian Public Service Commission regularly uses the
initialism ‘APSC’, so use it after the first mention and in the references.

Often, an organisation's name is both theauthor of the webpage and the name of
the website. To avoid repetition of long names, use the shortened form for the
name of the website after the title. Do this even if you have not introduced the
shortened form before.

<example>
Australian and New Zealand Spatial Information Council, [Place
names](https://www.anzlic.gov.au/resources/foundation-spatial-data-framework/fsdf-themes-datasets/place-names),
ANZLIC website, n.d., accessed 5 December 2019.
</example>

### Style and spell titles consistently

Use capitals, italics and punctuation consistently in all cited titles.

Follow the rules in the examples of documentary–note citations:

* Capitalise all proper nouns, the names of periodicals and the first word of the title or type of work.
* Use lower case for all other words.
* Use commas to separate elements.
* Use a full stop at the end of the reference.

Use italics for the [formal title of a complete published work](/node/187).

Don’t use italics if the reference is:

* a book chapter
* an article
* a poem
* an episode
* a page that is part of a series or a similar division.

If it’s part of a publication, use single quotation marks around the title and
use italics for the name of the series, book or periodical.

<example>
* J Mackenzie, The editor’s companion, 2nd edn, Cambridge University Press, Melbourne, 2011. [The italicised title is for a complete published work.]
* J Yik, ‘[Changing Australian medicine names](https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/changing-australian-medicine-names)’, Australian Prescriber, 1 June 2017, accessed 5 December 2019. [The reference is to a title for part of a publication (a periodical).]</example>

Use the original spelling for all titles and periodical names. This includes
retaining misspellings and using any American spelling variations.

<example>
S Bishop and F Back, ‘Organizational issues and color-coding’, Journal of
Pediatric Science, 2020, 4(2):22–25. [‘Organizational’ is an American spelling.]
</example>

#### Short citations in subsequent references

Use the shortened form of a title when you refer to the same work more than
once.

If the title is in italics or quotation marks in the full citation, use italics
or quotation marks in the short citation.

<example>
S Laurence, ‘Number and natural language’, in P Carruthers, S Laurence and S
Stitch (eds), The innate mind: structure and contents, Oxford University Press,
New York, 2005. [Full citation]

Laurence, ‘Number and natural language’. [Short citation]
</example>

Don’t hyperlink titles in short citations. The hyperlink in the full citation is
enough.

Short citations don’t include any subtitles.

<example>
P Lynch and S Horton, Web style guide: foundations of user experience design,
4th edn, Yale University Press, London, 2016. [Full citation]

Lynch and Horton, Web style guide. [Short citation]
</example>

#### Works without a date

For works without a date, write ‘n.d.’ instead of the date of publication.

<example>

##### Example

DA McMurrey, [Online technical writing:
lists](https://mcmassociates.io/textbook/lists.html), mcmassociates.io, n.d.,
accessed 30 September 2022.
</example>

#### Works that need the full date of publication

For works like newspaper articles and social media posts, include the full date
– not just the year – in the reference. This makes it easier for a user to find.

<example>
A Richardson, ‘[Australia imports almost all of its oil, and there are pitfalls
all over the
globe](https://theconversation.com/australia-imports-almost-all-of-its-oil-and-there-are-pitfalls-all-over-the-globe-97070)’,
The Conversation, 24 May 2018, accessed 29 January 2020.
</example>

### Hyperlink titles and include access dates for online works

Unless the source is behind a paywall, hyperlink the title of works available
online. Do this when you use the full title of the source (the first time you
include it in a note).

You don’t need to include the URL in references in digital content.

<example>

#### Example

A Richardson, ‘[Australia imports almost all of its oil, and there are pitfalls
all over the
globe](https://theconversation.com/australia-imports-almost-all-of-its-oil-and-there-are-pitfalls-all-over-the-globe-97070)’,
The Conversation, 24 May 2018, accessed 31 January 2020.
</example>

Content publishers should make sure the [CSS print style
sheet](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss) automatically displays
the URLs from the hyperlinks when the content is printed. This might be a
default style in your document's template.

If the document is print only, include a URL after the reference. Put the URL
after the final full stop.

<example>

#### Example

A Richardson, ‘Australia imports almost all of its oil, and there are pitfalls
all over the globe’, The Conversation, 24 May 2018, accessed 31 January 2020.
https://theconversation.com/australia-imports-almost-all-of-its-oil-and-there-are-pitfalls-all-over-the-globe-97070

[A print-only reference: the full hyperlink comes after the full stop, as the
title cannot be hyperlinked.]
</example>

Include the date you accessed the work. This is important because online sources
can change. The information you’re linking to could be different to what the
user will find in the future.

#### PDFs

If you’re citing a PDF, avoid linking directly to the PDF. Instead link to the
landing page where the PDF is hosted.

Landing pages tend to be a more stable place to link to. PDFs are often renamed
or moved around a site. Linking to a PDF also requires the user to download
content.

<example>

##### Example

Thomson Reuters Australia, ‘[Legislation and commentary table of
abbreviations](https://support.thomsonreuters.com.au/product/westlaw-au/articles/westlaw-au-guide-legislation-and-commentary-table-abbreviations)’,
Westlaw AU Guides, Thomson Reuters Australia, 2017, accessed 6 April 2020.

[The link targets a landing page, not a PDF.]
</example>

If the PDF doesn’t have a landing page, link to the PDF and include ‘PDF’ in
square brackets after the title. Follow ‘PDF’ with the file size in kilobytes
(KB) or megabytes (MB). Include both of these additional details in the linked
text.

Cite the PDF with the details you can find in the document. Sometimes details
like publication dates will be missing.

<example>

##### Example

Thomson Reuters Australia, [Table of abbreviations [PDF
94.35KB]](https://support.thomsonreuters.com.au/sites/default/files/2017-09/AU-WLAU-Guide-Leg-Com-Table-of-Abbreviations.PDF),
Thomson Reuters Australia, n.d., accessed 20 January 2020.
</example>

#### Digital object identifiers (DOIs)

A DOI is a series of numbers and punctuation that identifies a document. Unlike
a URL, a DOI stays the same always. [DOIs are also internationally
standardised](https://www.doi.org/index.html).

Works that have DOIs include most journal articles, some e-books and some PDFs.

If the document has a DOI, include it in the citation. Put it at the end of the
citation and include the shortened form ‘doi’ in lower case before it.

<example>

##### Example

T Kelleher, ‘Conversational voice’, Journal of Communication, 2009,
59(1):172–188, doi:10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.01410.x.
</example>

### Detail page, volume and issue numbers

To cite a specific page or page range in a work, add:

* the letter ‘p’ and the page number to cite one page
* the letters ‘pp’ and the page number range to cite a range of pages.

<example>

#### Example

* J Mackenzie, The editor’s companion, 2nd edn, Cambridge University Press, Melbourne, 2011, p 5.
* J Mackenzie, The editor’s companion, 2nd edn, Cambridge University Press, Melbourne, 2011, pp 5–11.</example>

If the citation has a volume number, an issue number and page numbers follow the
format: volume(issue):page–page.

<example>

#### Example

D Jackson, X Li and P Chandran, ‘Safety and equity’, Psychological Science
Australia, 2018, 2(4):223–240.
</example>

In this example, the work is from volume 2, issue 4, and it’s on pages 223 to
240.

To cite a specific page of this work, add the page number at the end.

<example>
#### Example

D Jackson, X Li and P Chandran, ‘Safety and equity’, Psychological Science
Australia, 2018, 2(4):223–240, p 225.
</example>

#### Parliamentary sources

Parliamentary papers, such as budget papers, white papers and annual reports,
are published:

* as individual documents
* as bound volumes of all documents tabled in a parliamentary sitting.

For individual documents, cite them as you would any document of that type. For
example, if you access an annual report on a departmental website, cite it as a
government report.

##### Bound parliamentary papers

</example>

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has a [guide to referencing ABS
material](https://www.abs.gov.au/how-cite-abs-sources).

Follow the ABS advice for information to include, but adjust capitalisation and
punctuation to be in line with the rest of the notes in your content.

<example>
##### Example

Australian Bureau of Statistics (2016) [2016 Census – Cultural
Diversity](https://guest.censusdata.abs.gov.au/webapi/jsf/dataCatalogueExplorer.xhtml)

</example>

#### Records from the National Archives of Australia

The National Archives of Australia (NAA) has a [guide to referencing records it
holds](https://www.naa.gov.au/help-your-research/using-collection/citing-archival-records).
Follow this advice exactly, but add a full stop at the end of the citation.

<example>
##### Example

</example>

### Reference all elements of online sources

Only cite an entire website if you cannot pinpoint the material to a specific
webpage or webpage content.

For example, you might mention a website as a general resource in the body text.
You would place a footnote marker with the in-text reference. The corresponding
note gives users the full details and link to that website.

However, if you refer to content only found on a particular webpage on the
website, you need to pinpoint the relevant webpage or webpage content in the
citation.

#### Entire website

Hyperlink the name of the website.

Always include the date you accessed the site at the end of the reference.

Use the same capitalisation as the organisation uses for the name of a website.

Include the word ‘website’ after the name of the website in square brackets,
unless you include the URL for the homepage.

It is optional to include the URL for the homepage – for example
‘stylemanual.gov.au’. If you include the homepage URL, do not include the word
‘website’ in square brackets.

Rule: A Author, Name of website, URL [optional], Year, accessed Day Month Year.

<example>
##### Example

* Australian Public Service Commission, [Australian Government Style Manual](/node/15), stylemanual.gov.au, 2022, accessed 23 October 2022

#### Webpages and webpage content

Hyperlink the title of the webpage. Don’t link to PDFs or other downloadable
documents. Instead link to the page that hosts the document.

Always include the date you accessed the site at the end of the reference.

Use the same capitalisation as the organisation uses for the name of a website.

Include the word ‘website’ after the name of the website, unless the name of the
website is a URL – for example ‘WA.gov.au’.

##### Webpage with authors listed

Rule: A Author, Title of webpage, Name of Website website, Year, accessed Day
Month Year.

<example>
###### Example

##### Tables and images

For tables and images (such as graphs) you’re using in the content, attribute
the source in the notes below the table or image (also called a ‘figure’).
Include permission or copyright information if necessary. Don’t include this
information or a reference marker in the caption or title to the table or
figure.

Rule: Source: Adapted from Source.

<example>
###### Example

</example>

##### Place of publication of a book

Only include the place of publication if it’s relevant to the user.

The place of publication may be relevant if:

* you’re citing works with editions published in multiple locations
* the location the book was published impacts the credibility of your work.

Editions of books published in different locations may have different spelling
conventions. For example, the same publisher may publish an edition in London
(using UK spelling) and an edition in New York (using US spelling).

Sometimes knowing the place of publication of the sources adds credibility to
the work. For example, an Australian publication may be more credible if it
cites books published in Australia. Including the publishing location clearly
shows users where the book is from.

If the place of publication doesn’t add useful information for the user, you can
omit it from your citation.

<example>
###### Example

Oxford University Press, New Oxford style manual, Oxford University Press, 2016.
</example>

#### Dictionaries and encyclopaedias

</example>

## Legal material

There are different conventions for how to cite legal material. Follow one style
consistently to help people read and use the information.

### Cite legal material consistently and accurately

It’s important to cite legal sources in a consistent and accurate way across
government.

The Style Manual gives common guidance for different types of legal material,
including:

* [bills and explanatory material](/node/207)
* [Acts of parliament](/node/208)
* [schedules](/node/209)
* [delegated legislation](/node/210)
* [cases and legal authorities](/node/211)
* [treaties](/node/212).

If your government agency has a legislative focus, you might need more detail.
For example, for an authoritative source for specific legal conventions, you
might use the 4th edn of the [Australian guide to legal
citation](https://law.unimelb.edu.au/mulr/aglc/about).

Use the Style Manual guidance to cite legal material for any type of content. If
you work on non-government material, follow the appropriate style for your
publication.

### Use the correct legislation title

Unless it is obvious from the context:

* Put the title first when writing in-text citations, footnotes and endnotes.
* Follow the title with the rest of the citation.

<example> 
* The Loans Security Act 1973 (subsection 5A(b)) provides for ...
* Commonwealth legislation (Loans Security Act 1973, subsection 5A(b)) provides for ...

[The citation pinpoints subsection 5A(b) of the Act after giving its title.]

</example>

Use the following databases to find the authorised titles of legislation from
each Australian jurisdiction.

#### Commonwealth

* [Federal Register of Legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.au/)

#### States and territories

* [ACT Legislation Register](https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/)
* [NSW legislation](https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/)
* [Northern Territory legislation](https://legislation.nt.gov.au/)
* [Queensland legislation](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/)
* [South Australian legislation](https://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/index.aspx)
* [Tasmanian legislation](https://www.legislation.tas.gov.au/)
* [Victorian legislation and parliamentary documents](http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/)
* [Western Australian legislation](https://www.legislation.wa.gov.au/)

#### Current (in force) or amending legislation

When you search or browse databases – such as the databases in the lists above –
look for legislation that is ‘consolidated’ or ‘in force’. This is current law.
Consolidated legislation includes all amendments made by other laws since the
legislation was first enacted. It is sometimes called the ‘principal
legislation’.

Amending legislation changes existing law. In legal databases, the version that
was originally enacted (not including later amendments) is called ‘as made’, ‘as
passed’ or, for Acts, ‘as enacted’.

The work of government has its basis in legislation. When you write about a
particular policy, service or program, you often need to refer to recent changes
to the relevant law (amending legislation). You will also name the legislation
that currently applies (consolidated legislation). You might have to write about
changes in the law over time. In this case, you would mention amending
legislation that is no longer in force.

The text of consolidated legislation includes information to show how it has
been amended over time. Look in the endnotes named ‘Legislation history’ and
‘Amendment history’ to find this information.

A useful way to track the history of legislation, particularly for historical
material not published online is to use The Office of Parliamentary Counsel
(OPC) [Legislation
tables](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Content/LegislationTables).

### Add detail to citations with notes

Writing about the law and legal matters requires careful citation.

You can use in-text citations and footnotes or endnotes (notes) to provide
accurate and complete details.

#### In-text citations

For general content, in-text citations often give people all the information
they need.

<example> 
* The Major Bank Levy Act 2017 imposes a levy on authorised deposit‑taking institutions.
* In South Australia v Commonwealth (First Uniform Tax Case), Chief Justice Latham of the Federal Court ...
</example>

#### Notes

Always list the legislation or case name first in a basic note.

Explanatory notes might vary. They can be a useful way to add extra information
that would otherwise clutter the content.

Each note has the corresponding superscript reference marker before it. Users
find the note by matching the number.

<example> 
* The levy threshold is indexed quarterly.1 [A superscript reference marker for the first note]
* The legislative basis for parliamentary remuneration and entitlements is complex.2 [A superscript reference marker for the second note]

1 Major Bank Levy Act 2017, subsection 4(3). [A basic note corresponding to the
first reference marker]

2 Section 48 of the Australian Constitution provides for the payment of members
of parliament. Commonwealth Acts include Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990,
Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, Ministers of State Act 1952,  ... other Acts and
associated delegated legislation. [An explanatory note corresponding to the
second reference marker]

</example>

In digital content, the reference markers can be hyperlinked to help users
access the note. Use hyperlinked endnotes in digital content.

##### Accessibility requirements

Reference markers and endnotes can be inaccessible to:

* people who have low vision
* people who use screen readers to access content
* users of mobile phones.

If using reference markers and endnotes, ensure they:

* are sized for easier readability
* will display correctly on mobile phones or other small screen devices
* can be made larger by users without loss of content or functionality
* can be read by screen readers.

Seek specialist advice to ensure you achieve this functionality.

##### Print considerations

In print, follow your organisation’s style preference for footnotes or endnotes.
Choose the style that people will find most useful.

### Include separate reference lists for legal material in 3 situations

Certain government agencies and specialist legal publications will use a
reference list.

Most government writers should only include a reference list if one of these
applies:

* People need the list to understand the content.
* The content includes a reference list for non-legal sources.
* It is agency style to have a reference list.

Set up separate lists under the subheadings ‘Legislation’ and ‘Legal cases’.
Arrange legislation and legal cases in alphabetical order under these headings.

Write the titles of Acts and legal cases in roman type, even though they’re
italicised in the text. Blocks of italics are difficult to read.

<example> 
[Reference list headings separate legislation from cases]

##### Legislation

Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Regulation 2016

Maintenance Orders (Commonwealth Officers) Act 1966

Major Bank Levy Act 2017

Marine Insurance Act 1909

##### Legal cases

Dutton v Republic of South Africa [1999] FCA 2

HT v The Queen [2019] HCA 40

South Australia v Commonwealth (1942) 65 CLR 373 (First Uniform Tax Case)

Victorian Railways Commissioners v Brown (1906) 3 CLR 1132

</example>

## Acts of parliament

Refer to Acts of parliament using the correct style so people can find the
source material. Choose when to cite the short and long titles, series numbers,
jurisdiction and sections.

### Style for Act titles is title case, not always italics

Use title case (maximal capitalisation) for the titles of Acts. Use italics for
the first mention of these titles.

Use roman type for the titles of Acts in reference lists and other long lists.
Blocks of italics are difficult to read.

The year the legislation is first enacted forms part of the title. Don’t use a
comma before the year.

<example>

#### Correct

Export Control Act 2020</example>

Include all the words in the title. If the title begins with ‘The’, ‘An’ or ‘A’,
make sure you include it.

<example>
* A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999
* The Commercial Bank of Australia Limited (Merger) Act 1982 (NSW)</example>

If the Act’s title has a number, include the number exactly as written. The
contraction ‘No.’ retains the full stop in this situation, which is an exception
to the [general rule for the shortened form for
‘number’](/node/191##only_use_the_contraction_no_with_numerals).

<example>
* Supply Act (No. 1) 2019–2020
* Farm Household Support Amendment (Relief Measures) Act (No. 2) 2019</example>

An Act has a short title (its name) and long title (a description). Both appear
after the list of contents in the text of the Act. The long title appears as a
heading before section 1 of the Act. The short title is named in section 1.

<example>
* **An Act relating to Currency, Coinage and Legal Tender** [Long title]
* **Part I—Preliminary**
* **1 Short title**
* This Act may be cited as the Currency Act 1965. [Short title]</example>

#### At first mention, use the short title in italics

The first time you name the Act in text, use the short title in italics.

<example>
The Currency Act 1965 established the Royal Australian Mint to produce
Australia’s circulating coins. The Act also sets restrictions on amounts that
can be paid in coins as ‘legal tender’.</example>

#### After first mention, use the short title in roman type without the year

Always use the short title in italics the first time you cite the Act in your
text.

If there are subsequent mentions of the Act, use the short title in roman type
without the year.

Add the shortened form in parentheses at the first mention if it does more than
just remove the year or the word ‘Act’ from the title.

<example>
* … was convicted of federal offences under the Crimes Act 1914. The Crimes Act specifies …
* … was convicted of federal offences under the Criminal Code Act 1995. The Criminal Code has a constitutional basis ...
* Comcare administers the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (WHS Act). The WHS Act requires that a person who ... [The shortened form goes with the first mention as it removes more than the year from the title.]</example>

#### Or use the informal title in roman type

Often, Acts also have a shorter informal title. This is usually an initialism or
acronym of the short title.

At first mention, include the informal title in parentheses after the title. Use
the informal title after that.

Use title case and roman type for the informal title.

<example>
* … in the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act). … Section 10 of the PGPA Act defines a Commonwealth entity as …
* Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act)</example>

### Each Act has a series number to use in citations

Acts are also identified by series. Every Act made in a year is given a number
starting at 1.

The series appears in the text of the Act immediately under the title, for
example ‘Act No. 137 of 1979’.

Using the series in general content helps people identify the particular Act and
find it in the Legislation Register. Series are also used in annotations and in
notes.

<example>
The Australian Citizenship Act 2007, by virtue of amendments made in 2013 (Act
No. 57 of 2013), gives the Minister the discretionary power to …</example>

### Jurisdiction is an important detail

It is important to identify the jurisdiction of the Act – that is, whether it is
an Act of:

* the Commonwealth
* a state or territory.

This helps people find the Act and understand where it applies. There are 2 ways
to do this.

#### Write a sentence that makes jurisdiction clear

The first way is to write a sentence that explains where the Act originates.
This method is useful in documents that don’t mention legislation frequently.

<example>
* The Tasmanian Local Government Act 1993 gave councils greater autonomy to act independently of the state government.
* Tasmania’s Local Government Act 1993 …</example>

#### Use the shortened form of the jurisdiction in the Act’s title in roman type and in parentheses

Alternatively, insert the jurisdiction’s shortened form in roman type in
parentheses after the italicised title.

Use these shortened forms:

* Cth (the Commonwealth)
* ACT (Australian Capital Territory)
* NT (Northern Territory)
* NSW (New South Wales)
* Qld (Queensland)
* SA (South Australia)
* Tas (Tasmania)
* Vic (Victoria)
* WA (Western Australia).

None of these shortened forms for jurisdictions are punctuated.

<example>
* Australia’s water resources in the Murray–Darling Basin are managed by laws of the Commonwealth and Basin States. Among others, this legislation includes the Water Act 2007 (Cth), Water Resources Act 2007 (ACT), Water Management Act 2000 (NSW), Water Act 2000 (Qld), Natural Resources Management Act 2004 (SA) and Water Act 1989 (Vic).
* Dugong are defined as ‘fish’ for the purposes of the Marine Act 1981 (NT).</example>

### An initial capital is correct, whether the reference is generic or not

Always use capitals for the words ‘Act’ and ‘Acts’ when you write about Acts of
parliament. This avoids possible confusion in publications, even those that are
mostly about the law. The words ‘act’ and ‘acts’ have several meanings.

<example>
Staff must read the Act to understand their compliance responsibilities.</example>

### The basic unit of an Act is a section (s)

An Act contains sections, which are often divided into subsections. Subsections
might be divided into paragraphs and subparagraphs.

Use lower case for these units unless they begin a sentence.

Sections are usually grouped into parts, divisions and subdivisions. An Act only
has subdivisions if there are divisions. Some larger Acts – for example, the
Criminal Code Act 1995 – group these units into chapters.

Always use an initial capital for a specific reference to a ‘Chapter’, ‘Part’,
‘Division’ or ‘Subdivision’.

#### Choose how to cite units below section level

Commonwealth Acts cite units at the smallest unit below section level. This is a
convention used by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in legislative drafting.

Some jurisdictions cite at section level.

<example>

##### Example

These citations specify the smallest unit of text:

* section 113V
* subsection 113V(4)
* paragraph 113V(4)(a)
* subparagraph 113V(4)(a)(ii).

Other jurisdictions might cite as ‘section 113V(4)(a)(ii)’. [A citation at
section level]</example>

Whether to cite at section level or below will depend on the context for your
content. You can choose which method to follow.

Content that discuss the operation and effect of certain subsections, paragraphs
and subparagraphs will cite at the smallest unit level. A general discussion
about the provisions of an Act might only cite at section level.

Follow in-house style. Otherwise, be guided by the type of content you’re
writing, and its purpose and audience.

#### Don’t use a full stop after the shortened forms of units

The units of an Act are written in long or shortened form (an abbreviation or
contraction), depending on the context. Never begin a sentence with
the shortened form.

Don’t use a full stop after the shortened form when you use it in a citation or
note.

### Titles of Acts from other countries are in roman type

Write all legislation from foreign countries in roman type, followed by the
country abbreviation.

If you’re not sure of an abbreviation, write the sentence to make the
jurisdiction clear.

<example>

#### Example

* Digital Economy Act 2017 (UK)
* Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (US)
* Arms Legislation Act 2019 (NZ)
* Foreign Investment Act 1999 (FIJ)
* Fiji’s Foreign Investment Act 1999</example>

### Reference to Australia’s Constitution needs capitalisation only

Always capitalise ‘Constitution’ when writing about Australia’s Constitution.

The Constitution was enacted by the British Parliament. The long title of the
Act is the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK).

Like all foreign Acts of parliament, it is written in roman type, not italics.

The original version is available on the [UK Government Legislation
website](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/63-64/12/contents/enacted). A
compilation including amendments is on the [Legislation
Register](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004Q00685).

How you refer to Australia’s Constitution depends on the context.

* Write ‘the Constitution’ when it’s clear that you’re referring to Australia’s Constitution.
* If you’re unsure, use ‘the Australian Constitution’ so there’s no confusion.

## Authoritative reports

Case citations rely on authorised and unauthorised law report series. Use the
correct abbreviations for Australian law report series. This will help people
find the judgements you cite.

### Cite an authorised law report if one is available

When you are referring to case law, you will generally cite a law report.

There are Commonwealth, state and territory law reports. They contain court
judgments in cases that are important for legal reasons.

Reported cases generally set a precedent for similar cases. A written judgement
is a useful summary of the key points of a case.

Not all court decisions are published. Where they are not published, they are
called unreported judgments. Unreported judgments are less persuasive than
reported judgments.

#### Authorised and unauthorised reports

Citations use common abbreviations for the titles of law reports. A law
report is part of either an authorised or unauthorised report series.

The courts review, annotate and approve authorised law reports for publication.
Wherever you can, cite an authorised law report using the relevant abbreviation.

Unauthorised law reports are legitimate reports that haven’t gone through the
same process before publication. Tribunals and smaller courts often have
unauthorised reports. These can be the only available reports of those
decisions.

### Use common abbreviations for authorised reports

This section lists common abbreviations for authorised law report series. Each
series comprises judgments by specific courts and tribunals.

State and territory reports have common abbreviations for series titles that
cover different periods.

### Use standard abbreviations for unauthorised reports

If the law report has no authorised version, you might need to use the
abbreviations from this select list of unauthorised law report series:

* ACLR (Australian Company Law Reports)
* ACompT (Australian Competition Tribunal)
* ALJR (Australian Law Journal Reports)
* ALR (Australian Law Reports)
* APO (Australian Patent Office)
* ATR (Australian Tax Reports)
* ATMO (Australian Trade Marks Office)

* FWC (Fair Work Commission)
* Fam LR (Family Law Reports)
* FCCA (Federal Circuit Court of Australia)
* FLR (Federal Law Reports)
* HCA (High Court of Australia)
* NNTA (National Native Title Tribunal).

## Bills and explanatory material

Cite bills and explanatory material using the right style to help people find
the source material.

### Style for bill titles is roman type, title case

A bill is a draft Act introduced into parliament. A bill becomes an Act when the
Governor-General gives assent to the bill after the Senate and House of
Representatives agree on its content.

Write the titles of bills in roman type, not italics.

Bills have a:

* short title (its name), which includes the year
* long title (a description).

In general, use the short title. Use title case (maximal capitalisation). There
is no comma between the title and year.

The long title uses sentence case.

<example> 
* Refugee Protection Bill 2019 [Short title]
* A Bill for an Act to provide a legislative response to all people seeking asylum in Australia, and for related purposes [Long title]
</example>

### Lower case is correct, unless the reference is to a specific bill

Always use an initial capital for the word ‘Bill’ when you write about a
specific bill: ‘the Bill’, ‘this Bill’.

If you are writing about 2 or more bills, use the lower case: ‘the bills’,
‘these bills’.

If you write about a bill or bills generally, use the lower case: ‘a bill’,
‘some bills’.

For bills, people are unlikely to find the lower case forms confusing. If
there’s any chance the text is unclear to readers, use a capital ‘B’.

<example> 
The government drafted a legislative package that includes 3 bills:

* the Religious Discrimination Bill 2019
* the Religious Discrimination (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019
* the Human Rights Legislation Amendment (Freedom of Religion) Bill 2019.
</example>

### The basic unit of a bill is a clause (cl)

Bills contain clauses, which become sections when bills become Acts. Clauses can
be divided into subclauses, then into paragraphs and then into subparagraphs.
Use lower case for these units of a bill unless they begin a sentence.

Long bills have clauses grouped into parts, divisions and subdivisions. Always
use an initial capital for these units, for example ‘Part 1’.

Bills often contain schedules. These are not units but are components of bills,
Acts and some delegated legislation.

#### Units below clause level

Commonwealth bills refer to units below clause level using the smallest unit of
text. This is a convention used by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in
legislative drafting. Some jurisdictions cite at clause level.

<example> 
These citations specify the smallest unit of text:

* clause 9
* subclause 9(4)
* paragraph 9(4)(a)
* subparagraph 9(4)(a)(ii).

Other jurisdictions might cite the subparagraph as ‘clause 9(4)(a)(ii)’. [A
citation at clause level]

</example>

Whether to cite at clause level or below will depend on the context for your
content. You can choose which method to follow.

Content that discusses the operation and effect of certain subclauses,
paragraphs and subparagraphs will cite at the smallest unit level. A general
discussion about the provisions of a bill will cite at clause level.

Follow in-house style. Otherwise, be guided by the type of content you’re
writing, and its purpose and audience.

#### Shortened forms for units

The shortened forms of ‘clause’ and ‘clauses’ are ‘cl’ and ‘cls’. Write them in
lower case and without a full stop.

The shortened forms of ‘subclause’ and ‘subclauses’ are ‘subcl’ and ‘subcls’.

The other units of bills mentioned above are also found in Acts.

You can use both the long and shortened forms of units for in-text citation and
notes. To decide which to use, think about the type of content, its users and
the amount of legal material cited in it. If the long form better helps people
understand the text, use it.

<example> 
* Clause 12 vests Commonwealth powers in the Minister …
* The Underwater Cultural Heritage Bill 2018 provides automatic protection for the remains of vessels located in Australian waters for at least 75 years (paragraph 16(1)(a)).
* 1 Commonwealth Registers Bill 2019, subcl 25(1).
</example>

### Explanatory material titles use roman type, title case

Explanatory material includes explanatory memoranda and explanatory statements.

An explanatory memorandum is a document tabled in parliament with a bill. It
explains the objective of a proposed law and how it will operate. The Australian
Government has provided explanatory memoranda with all government bills since
1982.

An explanatory statement is a similar document that accompanies delegated
legislation such as regulations and determinations.

Write titles in roman type. Use title case for the titles of explanatory
material.

Don’t use capitals for ‘explanatory memoranda’ and ‘explanatory statements’ when
writing about explanatory material in the general sense.

For content that mentions explanatory material often, use these shortened forms:

* EM (explanatory memorandum)
* EMs (explanatory memoranda or memorandums)
* ES (explanatory statement or statements).

Write them in parentheses at first mention and use the shortened form after
that.

<example> 
Material that does not form part of an Act (extrinsic material) can be used in
the interpretation of an Act. Extrinsic material includes explanatory
memorandums (EMs). The Legislation Register attaches an EM to each bill that is
introduced.

</example>

Write the titles of explanatory material as in-text citations to give context.

<example> 
The Parliamentary Precinct Regulations 2011 allow the law governing the
Parliamentary precinct to be applied to another location if Parliament House is
unavailable due to a major event such as ‘an earthquake’ or ‘terrorist attack’
(Explanatory Statement, Select Legislative Instrument 2011 No. 181).

</example>

## Cases and legal authorities

Cite cases, rulings and determinations using the correct style. Accuracy helps
people find the source material. Specify the law report or online legal
authority that hosts the relevant judgment or decision.

### Style for case names is title case, not always italics

A case is a matter to be settled at law. It is also an instance or the process
of making a claim in a court of law. Legal authorities are published sources of
legal reasoning, doctrine and rulings made by courts and similar bodies.

The people or organisations named in the case are known as ‘parties’. Capitalise
the names of the parties but use a lower case ‘v’ between the party names. There
is no full stop after ‘v’.

Case names have this basic form: Party v Party.

Write the name of the case in italics. This rule is for case names that are
mentioned briefly in general content.

Use roman type for cases in reference lists and other long lists. Blocks of
italics are difficult to read.

Always write the names as they appear in your source.

<example>
* In Commonwealth v Tasmania …
* The article discusses an important case in the High Court, Commonwealth v Tasmania.</example>

### The abbreviated title is in italics

Cases are often known by an abbreviated title. On first mention of the case
name, follow it with the abbreviated title in parentheses. For in-text
references, write this title in italics and use title case (maximal
capitalisation). You can then use the abbreviated title throughout the content.

Do not capitalise ‘the case’ or ‘this case’.

<example>
* … the important case in the High Court, Commonwealth v Tasmania (Tasmanian Dam Case). The case saw the Commonwealth …
* … the State of New South Wales v The Commonwealth (Wheat Case). The Wheat Case …</example>

### The full citation gives users detail they might need

Most government writing about cases requires a full citation. Citations show
people where to find the published authorised judgments and decisions of courts,
commissions and tribunals. They also tell people who made the decision and what
year it was made.

Citations can be in text or in notes, depending on organisational style and the
format of the content.

### Decisions are either reported or unreported

Reported decisions are published in authorised law reports (a report series).
For example:

* Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR) contain authorised reports of High Court decisions.
* Federal Court Reports (FCR) contain authorised reports of the Federal Court.
* Industrial Reports (IR) contain decisions of the Commonwealth Fair Work Commission.

Always cite an authorised report if it is available.

Unreported decisions are published in report series from the legal authorities
themselves. For example:

* High Court of Australia (HCA)
* Federal Court of Australia (FCA)
* Fair Work Commission (FWC).

The abbreviations for the report series of reported and unreported decisions are
different. Some unreported decisions are published in a report series later on.
This is why the same case might have 2 or more citations.

Use parentheses (round brackets) for reported decisions that use consecutive
volume numbers for the whole series. This means you don’t have to use the year
to find the volume on the shelf.

<example>
Reported decision with consecutive volume numbers for the whole series:

* name of the case: The State of New South Wales v The Commonwealth
* year of decision: (1915)
* volume of report series: 20
* report series abbreviation: CLR
* page number where the report begins: 54

[The full in-text citation or note is The State of New South Wales v The
Commonwealth (1915) 20 CLR 54 (Wheat Case).]</example>

Use square brackets for reported decisions that use the year as a volume number.
This means you must look for the year first, then for volume 1, 2 and so on.
Other years would also have a volume 1.

The authorised report of a case might have been published some time after the
decision was handed down.

<example>
Reported decision with the year as a volume number:

* name of the case: Kashemije Stud Pty Ltd v Hawkes
* year of report: [1978]
* volume of report series: 1
* report series abbreviation: NSWLR
* page number where the report begins: 143

[The full in-text citation or note is Kashemije Stud Pty Ltd v Hawkes [1978] 1
NSWLR 143. It tells you when the authorised report was published in the New
South Wales Law Reports. This might not be the year the NSW Supreme Court handed
down the decision.]</example>

Unreported decisions are always in square brackets. There is no volume number,
as the case is not part of an authorised report series. The legal authority
publishes the report in its own series.

<example>
Unreported decision with no volume number:

* name of the case: The State of NSW v The Commonwealth
* year of decision: [1915]
* volume of report series: (not reported in a volume)
* report series abbreviation: HCA
* judgment number [relates to year of decision]: 17

[The full in-text citation or note is The State of New South Wales v The
Commonwealth [1915] HCA 17 (Wheat Case). This citation tells you the High Court
of Australia published the decision.]</example>

### Civil and criminal case titles have different elements

Civil and criminal cases have specific citation elements. They differ.

In civil case titles, the ‘v’ is pronounced ‘and’. In criminal case titles, the
‘v’ is pronounced ‘against’.

#### For civil case titles, specify the first plaintiff and defendant

Civil cases usually involve a dispute between organisations or individuals. The
plaintiff is the person or organisation who files a complaint with the court.
The other party is the defendant.

<example>
Koowarta v Bjelke-Peterson (1982) 153 CLR 168

[The plaintiff was Koowarta, the defendant was Bjelke-Peterson]</example>

Most citations use only family names. Corporation names are usually given in
full, although abbreviations are acceptable.

Usually, citations use only the name of the first-mentioned party on each side
of a case.

Other parties are sometimes noted by the phrases:

* ‘and Others’ or ‘& Ors’
* ‘and Another’ or ‘& Anor’.

<example>
* SZIBU and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] FCA 108
* The State of Victoria and Others v The Commonwealth (1926) 38 CLR 399
* Cunningham & Ors v Commonwealth of Australia & Anor [2016] HCA 39</example>

#### In civil cases, use sentence case and italics for ‘Re’ and ‘Ex parte’

Sometimes the title of cases includes the terms ‘Re’ and ‘Ex parte’. Use
sentence case and write both in italics.

‘Re’ means ‘in the matter of’ and that is how it is said. ‘Re’ in the title of a
civil case means the court acts in a particular way – for example, in an
advisory capacity.

‘Ex parte’ means an application brought before the court by one party without
the other party having to be notified – for example, when one party applies for
an injunction.

<example>
Nduta v Minister for Immigration & Border Protection [2016] FCA 1596; Re
Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham
[2000] HCA 1; 74 ALJR 405.

An Ex parte application of Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police ...</example>

#### For criminal case titles, list all defendants

Criminal cases are usually initiated by the Commonwealth or state (for the
Crown) against people or organisations (the defendants) who are alleged to have
committed an offence under criminal law.

List the names of all defendants separated by a comma.

If prosecuting, the Crown is signified by an ‘R’ without a full stop. This is a
Latin abbreviation for ‘Rex’ or ‘Regina’, meaning ‘King’ or ‘Queen’.

<example>
* R v Bayda, R v Namoa (No 8) [2019] NSWSC 24 [The Crown against Bayda and Namoa as defendants]
* R v Alice Lynne Chamberlain and Michael Leigh Chamberlain [1982] NTSC [The Crown against Alice (Lindy) and Michael Chamberlain as defendants]</example>

If the Crown is the respondent in a criminal appeal, reverse the parties and
write ‘Appellant v The King’ (not ‘R’). If the Crown is the appellant, ‘The
King’ is the first party cited.

'The King' or 'The Queen' in the title is always retained as first published.
The title does not change when the monarch changes.

<example>
* Chamberlain v The Queen (1984) 153 CLR 521
* The Queen v Baden-Clay [2016] HCA 35
* House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 49</example>

### Subsequent citations in notes use the first party

When citing cases using notes, always use a full citation as the first citation.
After that, you can use the name of the first party, followed by the case
citation.

<example>

#### Example

* 1 Steinmetz v Shannon (2019) 99 NSWLR 687. [The full citation the first time]
* 8 Steinmetz (2019) 99 NSWLR 687. [Only the first party to the case in a subsequent note]</example>

### Pinpoint citations use ‘at’ for page and paragraph numbers

If you use notes, write pinpoint page numbers for the citation using ‘at [page
number]’.

You can follow the page number with the number of the relevant paragraph as it
appears in the judgment. Write the paragraph number in square brackets.

Use a comma to list separate pinpoint citations.

<example>

#### Example

* 1 Ruddock v Vadarlis (2001) 110 FCR 491 at 1191. [The pinpoint citation is on page 1191.]
* 2 Rojoda Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (2018) 368 ALR 734 at 737 [10], 760 [108]. [The pinpoint citations are at page 737 (paragraph 10) and page 760 (paragraph 108).]
* 3 Gedeon v The Queen (2013) 237 A Crim R 326 at 361–362 [174]–[178]. [The pinpoint citation is for pages 361 to 362 (paragraphs 174 to 178).]</example>

### Decisions can differ between judges or magistrates

Identify the judicial officer whose judgment you are citing. Cite the case fully
and add ‘per [name] [judicial office abbreviation]’.

Use these abbreviations:

* J (Justice)
* JJ (Justices)
* CJ (Chief Justice)
* ACJ (Acting Chief Justice)
* FM (Federal Magistrate)
* JA (Justice of Appeal)
* DCJ (District Court Judge).

<example>

#### Example

* UBS AG v Tyne (2018) 92 ALJR 968 at 979 [45] per Kiefel CJ, Bell and Keane JJ, [61] per Gageler J.
* Mabo v Queensland [No 2] (1992) 175 CLR 1 at 106–107 per Deane and Gaudron JJ.
* 1 Ward v The Queen [2000] WASCA 413; (2000) 23 WAR 254 at 25 per Kennedy J.
* Chief Justice Kiefel and Bell and Edelman JJ accepted that such agreements would be excluded.</example>

### Titles for Commonwealth tribunal decisions are in italics

Write the title of all tribunal decisions in italics.

Tribunals are adjudicative institutions with powers to:

* review government and administrative decisions
* make administrative decisions
* investigate matters
* settle claims and disputes.

Most tribunals are established by Acts of parliament which set out their powers,
functions and operations. Acts give tribunals the legal authority to make
decisions. There are tribunals in each state and territory.

Under the Constitution, only federal courts have the judicial power of the
Commonwealth. Commonwealth tribunals exercise administrative rather than
judicial power.

Federal courts cannot review administrative decisions made by government, so
parliament often gives this power to a tribunal.

The president and members of a tribunal can be judges. For example, the
President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is a judge of the Federal Court
of Australia.

#### Find the decision title on the tribunal website or an alternative

Decisions are published on tribunal websites, on the [Federal Court of
Australia’s
website](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/digital-law-library/judgments/search) or on
[AustLII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/).

There are a large number of Commonwealth tribunals, including:

* the [Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)](https://www.aat.gov.au/)
* the [Australian Competition Tribunal](https://www.competitiontribunal.gov.au/)
* the [Copyright Tribunal of Australia](https://www.copyrighttribunal.gov.au/)
* the [Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal](https://www.defenceappeals.gov.au/practice-directions)
* the [Fair Work Commission](https://www.fwc.gov.au/)
* the [National Native Title Tribunal](https://www.nntt.gov.au/Pages/Home-Page.aspx).

The AAT has an authorised report series – the Administrative Law Decisions
(ALD). The AAT’s unauthorised report series, AATA, is available on AustLII.

The Fair Work Commission also has an authorised report series – the Industrial
Reports (IR). Unauthorised reports are available on the commission’s website.

Always cite the authorised report if it has been published and you have access
to it.

<example>

##### Example

* Minister for Home Affairs v AYJ17 [2019] FCA 591; 165 ALD 64 [Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision, also published by the Federal Court of Australia as decision 591 of 2019]
* Application by Flexigroup Limited [2020] ACompT 1 [Australian Competition Tribunal decision]
* Application by Isentia Pty Limited [2018] ACopyT 4 [Copyright Tribunal of Australia decision]
* McCleave v Chief of Navy [2019] ADFDAT 1 [Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal decision]
* David Thomas and Frederick (Junior) Faamausili Ailua v Virgin Australia Airlines Pty Ltd t/a Virgin Australia [2019] FWC 4464 [Fair Work Commission decision]
* Kyburra Munda Yalga Aboriginal Corporation RNTBC v Rock Solid Holdings Pty Ltd & Another [2020] NNTTA 31 (11 March 2020) [National Native Title Tribunal decision]</example>

### Titles for Tax Commissioner rulings have unique elements

The Commissioner of Taxation has the power to make rulings – public, private and
oral – that interpret the laws administered by the Australian Taxation Office
(ATO).

Public rulings comprise rulings and determinations and are legally binding
advice. Draft and final public rulings are published on the [ATO Legal
Database](https://www.ato.gov.au/Law).

The full titles of public rulings have 3 elements that appear in a set order:

1. a ruling or determination type – for example, ‘Goods and Services Tax Ruling’
2. a number – for example, ‘GSTR 2019/1’
3. a title in italics – for example, Goods and services tax: supply of anything other than goods or real property connected with the indirect tax zone (Australia).

Write the full title at first mention.

<example>

#### Example

Goods and Services Tax Ruling GSTR 2019/1 Goods and services tax: supply of
anything other than goods or real property connected with the indirect tax zone
(Australia)</example>

#### Specify whether it’s a ruling or determination in all subsequent mentions

For subsequent mentions, write the type of ruling or determination or write the
number.

Use an initial capital when you refer to specific rulings.

<example>

##### Example

Class Ruling CR 2019/19 Income tax: Department for Health and Wellbeing South
Australia Early Retirement Program 2019 [A full citation of the title for a
ruling]

Options for subsequent mentions of this Ruling:

* ‘The Class Ruling’
* ‘the Ruling’
* ‘CR 2019/19’.

Taxation Determination TD 2019/13 Income tax: what is an ‘employee share
trust’? [A full citation of the title for a determination]

Options for subsequent mentions of this Determination:

* ‘The Taxation Determination’
* ‘the Determination’
* ‘TD 2019/19’.</example>

#### In notes, cite the title, source and paragraph numbers

If you use notes, cite the ATO Legal Database as the source.

For pinpoint citations, use paragraph numbers for public rulings (rather than
page numbers). Write the paragraph number in square brackets preceded by the
words ‘para’ or ‘paras’.

For subsequent notes for the same public ruling, cite the number (and paragraphs
for a pinpoint citation).

<example>

##### Example

* 4 Australian Taxation Office, Fuel Tax Determination FTD 2019/1 Fuel tax: fuel tax credits – vehicles and satisfying environmental criteria, ATO Legal Database, para [4]. [The full citation the first time; specifies the source and pinpoints paragraph 4]
* 15 FTD 2019/1, paras [6]–[8]. [Only the determination number in a subsequent note; pinpoints paragraphs 6 to 8 for the citation]</example>

## Delegated legislation

Follow the correct style to cite delegated legislation made under the authority
of an Act. This will help people find the source material.

### Delegated legislation comes in many forms

Delegated legislation is made under the authority of an Act, not by the Act
directly. For example, parliament may delegate this authority to a minister,
statutory bodies or office holders.

Regulations are the most common type of delegated legislation. There are many
others, including:

* determinations
* ordinances
* proclamations
* orders
* rules
* by-laws
* standards
* principles.

Some jurisdictions refer to delegated legislation as ‘subordinate legislation’,
‘subsidiary legislation’ or ‘statutory rules’.

Some, but not all, types of delegated legislation are [legislative
instruments](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Browse/ByTitle/LegislativeInstruments/).
‘Legislative instrument’ is defined in section 8 of the [Legislation Act
2003](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A01224). All legislative
instruments are registered on the [Legislation
Register](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Home). Regulations are legislative
instruments.

The Legislation Register also contains [notifiable
instruments](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Browse/ByTitle/NotifiableInstruments/).
These are not legislative, but are notices about legal matters of interest to
the public. An example is the Order to Call Out the Australian Defence Force
Reserves [No. 2], made during Australia’s bushfire crisis in 2020.

### Style for regulations titles is roman type, title case

Use title case (maximal capitalisation) and roman type for the titles of
regulations.

Always capitalise ‘Regulations’ or ‘Regulation’ when you write the title of
regulations and refer to particular regulations.

Cite the title exactly without altering the spelling. The year forms part of the
title. There is no comma between title and year.

<example> 
* The Ombudsman Regulations 2017 is an instrument made under the Ombudsman Act 1976. These Regulations …
* Superannuation Industry Supervision Regulations 1994 (Cth)
* Workers’ Compensation and Injury Management Regulations 1982 (WA)
</example>

### The basic unit of regulations is a regulation (reg)

Regulations are compilations made up of individual regulations. Each regulation
might be divided into subregulations.

Use lower case when citing an individual regulation or subregulation, unless
they begin a sentence.

Some titles are singular so check to make sure you write the title correctly. A
singular regulation still contains regulations and subregulations.

<example> 
* … pursuant to regulation 58 of Defence Regulation 2016. [Note the full title of the Regulation is singular]
* Regulation 4A and subregulation 4AA(2) of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956. [Note the full title of the Regulations is plural.]
* The Regulations deal with the importation of plastic explosives into Australia (regulation 4AA).
</example>

The shortened forms of regulations and subregulations are:

* reg
* regs
* subreg
* subregs.

<example> 
An authorised officer under the Water Act 2007 will be issued with an identity
card … The associated regulations specify other mandatory features of the card,
including the Commonwealth Coat of Arms (Water Regulations 2008, reg 10.1).

</example>

Regulations receive a unique identifier when registered on the Legislation
Register – for example, F2019C00400 (Ombudsman Regulations 2017). You can use
the identifier to search for regulations or to point users to earlier superseded
regulations.

<example> 
… the licence variations prescribed in the Water Amendment Regulation 2012 (No.
1) (F2012L01015).

</example>

### Other delegated legislation follows title case, no italics

Style for all other titles of delegated legislation is the same as for
regulations.

Use roman type and title case for citations that give the full title.

Use an initial capital for a reference to a specific instrument. Use lower case
for generic references.

#### Determinations

Use the long form ‘Determination’ for in-text citations and notes.

<example> 
Remuneration Tribunal (Members of Parliament) Determination No. 2 2019, Part 6

Financial Management Determination 2019 (Tas)

</example>

Use a capital ‘D’ when you refer to a particular determination or to
determinations.

Use a lower case ‘d’ when you write about generic determinations.

<example> 
Under section 10 of the Australian Passports Determination 2015. This
Determination ...

The Act allows benefits to be varied by determination of the Remuneration
Tribunal.

</example>

#### Orders

Use the long forms ‘Order’ and ‘Orders’ for in-text citations and notes.

<example> 
Marine Order 44 (Safe Containers) 2019, subsection 6(1)

</example>

Use a capital ‘O’ when you refer to a particular order or to orders.

Use a lower case ‘o’ when you write about generic orders.

<example> 
* The calculation methods for associate deferred pension annual rates are prescribed by the Judges’ Pensions Order 2013, section 8. The Order … [A specific reference]
* In Australia, exports are regulated through legislation, regulations and orders. [A generic reference]
</example>

#### Ordinances

Use the long forms ‘Ordinance’ and ‘Ordinances’ for in-text citations and notes.

<example> 
 

Administration Ordinance 1990 (Jervis Bay Territory), section 3A

</example>

Use a capital ‘O’ when you refer to a particular ordinance.

Use a lower case ‘o’ when you write about generic ordinances.

<example> 
 

… the Norfolk Island Administrator Ordinance 2016. The Ordinance …

The Governor-General has the power to make ordinances for the peace, order and
good government of the Jervis Bay Territory.

</example>

Acts in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory were known
as ordinances until self-government.

#### Rules

A rule is made by judges or legislation setting out how a court will conduct its
proceedings.

Don’t use ‘rule’ and ‘ruling’ interchangeably. They are different things.
Rulings are authoritative decisions made by a court or similar body about
matters before them.

Use a capital ‘R’ when you refer to a particular rule or rules.

Use a lower case ‘r’ when you write about generic rules.

<example> 
##### Example

 

… High Court Rules 2004. The Rules …

The Minister has the power to make rules under the National Land (Road
Transport) Ordinance 2014.

</example>

Units for rules are ‘rules’ and ‘subrules’.

Use lower case for their shortened forms:

* r (rule)
* subr (subrule)
* rr (rules)
* subrr (subrules).

<example> 
##### Example

 

Sittings of a Full Court are held at places and on days fixed by rule of Court
or as appointed by the Chief Justice (High Court Rules 2004, rr 6.04.1 and
6.04.2).

If an appeal relates to a private ruling by the ATO Commissioner, the sealed
copy of the notice of appeal must be served within 6 days after filing (Federal
Court Rules 2011, r 33.03.5).

</example>

## Schedules

Refer to schedules that appear at the end of legislation using style
conventions. Follow the drafting rules for amending and non-amending schedules
so people can find the source information.

### Schedules are components of legislation

Schedules are components (not units) of bills, Acts and some instruments. They
appear at the end of legislation. Schedules are either amending or non-amending.

Amending schedules are more common. There are drafting rules about their use and
the order in which each schedule appears.

Most amending schedules list amendments to other Acts, bills and instruments
that will take effect when the legislation commences. Some contain other
provisions such as savings and transitional arrangements.

Non-amending schedules have many different purposes. Units of non-amending
schedules are named differently depending on the purpose. Non-amending schedules
sometimes include text that could be contained in the body of the legislation as
a section. In this case, the basic unit is a clause.

Cite at schedule level, not the basic unit level, for most content.

### Style for schedule titles is an initial capital

Use capital ‘S’ for long and shortened forms of named schedules.

Always capitalise ‘Schedule’ or ‘Schedules’ when you write the title of
schedules or refer to particular schedules.

The shortened form is ‘Sch’ for singular and plural.

<example> 
* ... the age factor under Schedule 1 of the Judges’ Pensions Regulations 1998
* ... the age factor (Judges’ Pensions Regulations 1998, Sch 1).
* … namely items 28, 41, 45 and 52 of Schedule 1 to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Act 2006.
</example>

### The basic unit of an amending schedule is an item

For most texts, you don’t need to identify the units of different types of
schedules or to decide how units should be cited. It is enough to cite at
schedule level.

Amending schedules are divided into parts, then into divisions. Both are given
arabic numerals – for example, Part 1 Division 3. Divisions contain items
divided into subitems, which are given numbers in parentheses – (1), (2) and so
on.

There is no shortened form for ‘item’ or ‘subitem’.

## Treaties

Treaties are made under international law. Follow the correct style to help
people to access titles, series information and detailed citations.

### Treaty citations need the correct title and series information

A treaty is an international agreement that is binding under international law.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade explains the different types of
treaties and how they are made in the [Treaty making
process](https://dfat.gov.au/international-relations/treaties/treaty-making-process/Pages/treaty-making-process.aspx).

Sometimes a Commonwealth Act of parliament is required to give effect to a
treaty – for example, the Antarctic Treaty Act 1960.

Treaties also include conventions, international agreements, covenants, an
exchange of letters, international instruments, charters or protocols.

Treaties appear in various official series published by countries and
international organisations.

Australian treaties are published in the Australian Treaty Series (ATS). Other
series include the United Nations Treaty Series (UNTS), the United States
Treaties and Other International Agreements (UST) and the United Kingdom Treaty
Series (UKTS).

To search for the titles, short titles and series information for treaties that
Australia has signed or taken other action on, use the [Australian Treaties
Database](https://dfat.gov.au/international-relations/treaties/Pages/treaties.aspx).
You can also use AustLII’s [Australian Treaties
Library.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/index.html)

For other series, use the WorldLII [Treaties and International
Agreements](http://www.worldlii.org/catalog/2266.html) database
catalogue. Alternatively, go directly to the relevant databases. These include
the [United Nations Treaty Collection](https://treaties.un.org/), [UK Treaties
Online](https://treaties.fco.gov.uk/responsive/app/consolidatedSearch/) and, for
the US, [Treaties and Other International Acts
Series](https://www.state.gov/tias/).

### Style for treaty titles is roman type, title case

Write titles of treaties in roman type with title case (maximal capitalisation).
Follow the full title with the short title in parentheses and use the short
title after that.

<example> 
The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty (SPNFP) is also known as the Treaty
of Rarotonga.

</example>

The year the treaty is made does not form part of the title. If you include it,
write it into the sentence or add it in parentheses after the short title.

<example> 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) (1966)

</example>

In general publications, citing the title of the treaty is usually enough.

<example> 
* Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (Basel Convention). Australian signed the Basel Convention in 1992.
* The Charter of the Organization of African Unity was adopted by participating governments in May 1963.
</example>

### Detailed citations for treaties have many elements

You might need a detailed citation for an in-text citation, notes or a reference
list.

Write the citation this way:

* title
* (place of making, date of making)
* [year treaty entered into force]
* treaty series and volume number
* page number in the series volume.

Don’t use any punctuation between the elements.

The square brackets follow the style used in the Australian Treaties Database.

(Tip: Use the 'registered' year to search the database for the year a treaty
entered into force in the [United Nations Treaty
Collection](https://treaties.un.org/).

<example> 
* Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (Basel, 22 March 1989) [1992] UNTS 1673 p 57.
* Singapore–Australia Free Trade Agreement (Singapore, 17 February 2003) [2003] ATS 16.
* South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty (Rarotonga, 6 August 1985) [1986] ATS 32, UNTS 1445 p 177; ILM 24 p 1440; NZTS 1986/7.
</example>

If a short title has been introduced and used in the text, you can use the short
title in the note.

Always use the long title in a reference list.

<example> 
* The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) entered into force on 23 March 1976.1 [In-text reference]
* 1 ICCPR (New York, 16 December 1966) [1980] ATS 23. [Short title in the note that gives the citation]
* International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (New York, 16 December 1966) [1980] ATS 23. [Long title in reference list entry]
</example>

## Shortened forms used in referencing

Shortened forms are used in referencing to help people quickly identify sources.
Unlike other shortened forms, some Latin shortened forms retain full stops. 

### Use roman type, not italics

In referencing, present shortened forms in roman type (not italics). Always
start them with a lower case letter, even when they are derived from Latin
words.

Only some Latin shortened forms and ‘n.d.’ take full stops.

Shortened forms commonly used in citationsShortened formsMeaningartarticleappappendixc.circa (about, approximately)cf.compare (from Latin confer)chchaptercol, colscolumn(s)divdivisiondoidigital object identifiered, edseditor(s)edneditionet al.and others (from Latin et alii)et seq.and following (from Latin et sequens)fig, figsfigure(s)fn, fnnfootnote(s)ibid.in the same place (from Latin ibidem)id.the same (from Latin idem)ill, illsillustrator(s)inf.below (from Latin infra)l, llline(s)loc. cit.in the place cited (from Latin loco citato)MS, MSSmanuscript(s)n, nnnote(s)n.d.no datenpno placeop. cit.in the work cited (from Latin opere citato)p, pppage(s)para, parasparagraph(s)plplatept, ptspart(s)revrevisedserseriessup.above (from Latin supra)supplsupplementtranstranslator(s)vol, volsvolume(s)

### Avoid Latin shortened forms in referencing systems

The terms ‘ibid.’, ‘op. cit.’, ‘loc. cit.’ and ‘id.’ are sometimes used in the
documentary–note system and other styles of referencing.

This is no longer common usage. These terms should be avoided unless they are
required by a publisher.

The term ‘ibid.’ refers users to the same publication that was cited immediately
before it. It can refer to the same page or to a different one.

<example> 
1. R Hyslop, Aye aye, Minister, AGPS Press, Canberra, 1990, p 89.
2. ibid.
3. ibid., p 160.

[These 3 references all cite the same publication (Hyslop’s Aye aye, Minister).
The third reference cites a different page number.]

</example>

The term ‘op. cit.’ refers users back to information from different pages in the
same publication. The difference between ‘ibid.’ and ‘op. cit.’ is that there
can be several references between the first mention of the publication and later
mentions.

<example> 
1. R Hyslop, Aye aye, Minister, AGPS Press, Canberra, 1990, p 89.
2. ... [works by other authors]
3. R Hyslop, op. cit., p 171.

[Two of the references use information from different pages in the same
publication (Hyslop’s Aye aye, Minister, pages 89 and 171).]

</example>

The term ‘loc. cit.’ refers the reader back to the same page of a publication
already cited.

<example> 
1. R Hyslop, Aye aye, Minister, AGPS Press, Canberra, 1990, p 89.
2. ... [works by other authors]
3. R Hyslop, loc. cit.

[Both references use information from page 89 of the same publication (Hyslop’s
Aye aye, Minister).]

</example>

The term ‘id.’ signifies that the work in the second note is by the same author
as the work in the first note.

<example> 
1. R Hyslop, Aye aye, Minister, AGPS Press, Canberra, 1990, p 89.
2. id., Australian mandarins: perceptions of the role of departmental secretaries, AGPS Press, Canberra, 1993, p 45.

[Both works are by R Hyslop.]

</example>

## Headings

Headings help users scan content and find what they need. Organise content using
clear heading levels. Begin each heading with keywords and keep it to the point.

### Write headings that are clear and short

Headings organise information. Clear headings are specific to the topic they
describe.

Keep them brief. They are signposts for people and for search engines.

Many people skim through headings to check whether a page is relevant before
they read it in detail. Search engines use headings to analyse and rank content.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.
* I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.

Fundamentals:

* Write clear page titles. This is the first topic a screen reader user will hear and should align with the first heading on the page.
* Organise content with a clear structure using section headings. Clearly describe the topics or the following section in the headings.
* Make sure all users can navigate through all content in the intended order, regardless of the technology they are using. Use the same navigation elements consistently across services.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [1.3.1 Info and relationships – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##info-and-relationships)
* [2.4.2 Page titled – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##page-titled)
* [2.4.6 Headings and labels – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##headings-and-labels)
* [2.4.10 Section headings – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##section-headings)

#### State the main point

Write headings that tell the user what is in the content below it.

Headings should state the main point. This helps users find and use content in
search results and on social media.

Use words that accurately describe the content. Don’t use empty words or phrases
(for example, ‘more’ or ‘related information’).

Only include information in the section that is relevant to the heading. If the
information isn’t relevant, move it or rewrite the heading.

<example> 
Learn how to drive

</example>

#### Use fewer than 70 characters

Write headings that are no more than 70 characters (including spaces).

Longer headings are more difficult to read and can be confusing. They might also
suggest that you have too many ideas in a section.

#### Avoid questions as headings

Using questions pushes your main idea towards the end of the heading.

Starting a heading with ‘why’, ‘how’ or ‘what’ makes it slower for the user to
read. They have to read the whole heading before finding relevant keywords.

### Use keywords to start headings

Start headings and subheadings with keywords that help people to make a
connection.

People scan-read headings to know the relevance of the content. If they use
assistive technologies, they might use the tab key to read from heading to
heading. Others who use screen readers might generate a list of headings for
quick navigation.

The keywords should relate to the main content below the heading. Pay special
attention to the first 2 or 3 words. These might be the only words someone reads
to decide whether to continue to scan the page or to read the text.

Using keywords at the start of a heading is called ‘frontloading’. Frontloading
makes it easier for people to assess the heading’s relevance – either on a web
page or in search results. It also helps [search engines find your
content](/node/72).

<example> 
Use keywords to start headings

</example>

### Organise heading levels in a logical order

Heading hierarchy is the relationship between main headings and subheadings. The
[hierarchical structure shows users how topics fit together](/node/79).

A clear and logical heading hierarchy shows readers where to find information
and how important it is.

Keep each section concise and use headings to chunk information so it works well
on screen for the user.

Heading levels include main titles, headings and subheadings:

* Level 1 headings are titles of webpages or titles of chapters in a book or printed [report](/node/47).
* Level 2 headings are main headings.
* Level 3 headings are subheadings.
* Level 4 headings are sub-subheadings (headings under subheadings).

#### Don’t skip heading levels

Write headings in a complete organised hierarchy.

A complete hierarchy helps people scan the content to find the information they
need. Screen reader users need to be able to rely on heading level hierarchy to
find relevant content.

#### Use one level 1 heading

Use just one level 1 heading per webpage. Make it unique to your site. This
helps users understand the content and find it using search engines.

The level 1 heading is also a good place to include target keywords needed for
[search engine optimisation](/node/103).

##### Print considerations

In documents, use level 1 headings (or ‘Heading 1’ style) for the main sections,
such as part titles.

#### Make the headings relate

Every heading and subheading must relate to the heading above it so the grouping
of information is logical and clear for users.

#### Avoid level 5 and deeper heading levels

Try to use only 3 or 4 heading levels at the most. A simpler structure is easier
to read.

You can use deeper heading levels (level 4 and below) for very complex
documents, but try to avoid it.

Deep and complex hierarchies of headings are a sign that you are probably trying
to do too much on a webpage or in a chapter. It is likely that you will lose the
reader.

#### Space out headings

Separate each heading from the next one by some text, even if it’s only a
sentence. This helps create a clear distinction between ideas.

#### Create at least 2 headings for each level

Give each heading level in a section at least one other heading at the same
level. This avoids the appearance of stranded ideas.

<example> 
* H1: Apply for a drivers licence
* H2: Pass the theory test
* H3: Learn the road rules
* H3: Book a theory test
* H2: Pass the driving test
* H3: Practise for the test
* H3: Book the driving test
</example>

#### Use numbered headings only for steps

Use numbered headings only when they relate to a series of steps. Numbered
headings can [help users through a sequential structure](/node/78).

##### Print considerations

In print, you can use numbered headings to help people cross-reference
information:

* If you use numbered headings, use them only in the body.
* Don’t use numbered headings in the preliminary pages or endmatter in a report.
* Don’t number more than the first 3 heading levels.

### Be consistent: use a parallel structure

All headings in a level should be consistent.

They should have the same:

* overall message (for example, they are all steps in a process)
* grammatical form (called ‘parallel structure’).

Two common forms are:

* noun phrases (for example, ‘effective headings’ and ‘punctuation and capitalisation’)
* instructions (for example, ‘keep headings short’ and ‘be consistent’).

### Use unique formatting for each level of heading

Format headings so the heading levels are visibly different. This helps users
scan the text.

People should be able to tell the difference between heading levels at a glance.

Formatting options include:

* font weights and sizes that are distinct from one another – a larger, bolder font for main headings and a smaller, lighter font for lower-level subheadings
* colour to help people scan the headings – but don’t rely on colour as the only way to differentiate heading levels
* spacing above a heading to help people see the visual break from one section to the next.

#### Don’t add an underline

Don’t underline headings or any other text.

Underlined text looks like a hyperlink, which can confuse users. It also makes
it harder to read letters with descenders (for example, ‘p’, ‘y’ and ‘g’ in
‘Applying for government support’).

#### Apply HTML elements, tags and styles to headings

Use styles, tags and HTML elements to identify headings in digital content.

Correctly styled and tagged headings:

* make it easy to create consistent headings
* help software build an automatic table of contents
* are needed for accessibility of digital content
* help search engines understand the topic that you’re writing about.

##### Print considerations

Correctly styled headings make it easier for graphic designers to know how to
lay out the publication, including what weighting to give each heading.

The reader should see at least one heading on each double-page spread in a
printed document.

Don’t leave a heading at the bottom of the page with no text below it. Send the
heading to the top of the next page so it stays with the content below it.

##### HTML elements

Use the correct HTML element for the heading level.

Your content management system should have inbuilt heading styles that you can
apply to text.

<example> 
A page about paying your tax might use these headings:

* H1 = ‘Lodging your tax return’ (the page title)
* H2 = ‘Individual tax return’ (a heading for a main section)
* H3 = ‘Lodging online’ (a subheading)
* H4 = ‘Creating an account’ (a sub-subheading)
</example>

##### System heading styles

Apply correct inbuilt heading styles so they can be automatically added to
navigation and contents pages.

If your organisation uses templates, use the template styles.

###### Print considerations

Some organisations have their own heading style guidelines.

If no guidelines apply, use a ‘Heading 1’ style for the main sections in the
document. The title of a document uses the ‘Title’ style.

### Write all headings in sentence case and use minimal punctuation

Use sentence case for headings to help people read the text more easily.

This means you should use a capital letter only for:

* the [first letter of the first word](/node/116##capitalise_the_first_word_in_a_sentence_and_in_headings)
* the first letter of any [proper nouns](/node/122)
* letters in [acronyms and initialisms](/node/190).

Don’t write headings in all capital letters as users could misread words. For
example, ‘ACT’ could be ‘act’ (the verb) rather than the initialism for the
Australian Capital Territory.

If you work for an organisation that uses all capitals for headings, make sure
any abbreviations are easy to understand.

#### Don’t use a full stop to end headings

Even if the heading is a sentence, it doesn’t need a full stop at the end.

#### Avoid using shortened forms in headings

Don’t use a shortened form in a heading unless it is better known than the full
term (for example, ‘DNA’ and ‘CSIRO’).

##### Digital Service Standard requirements

To ensure the content works on all devices, use [responsive design
methods](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/6-consistent-and-responsive-design).

Many people do not use a desktop computer or printed material to access services
and information. Test content on a mobile device first.

## Links

Links can help users navigate content. Include links when they support user
journeys and for search engine optimisation. Write link text that is accurate
and accessible.

### Link to something only if it helps meet the user’s need

Links (hyperlinks) are words or images that users can click to go to other
content.

Links help people navigate digital services or products. But they can also
reduce readability and increase cognitive load. For this reason, use them only
when they support a user need.

Links are also important for [search engine
optimisation](/node/71/##create_useful_links_to_highquality_content). Search
engines use links to:

* discover webpages
* determine how they rank in search results.

Use text for links in most cases. These links are called anchor text.

Use images for links only if they meet a user need. If you do use images,
accurately describe the link with [alt text](/node/49). Don’t describe the image
itself.

#### Digital Service Standard requirements

You must understand users and their context for using the service to meet the
Digital Service Standard: [Criterion 1. Understand user
needs](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/1-understand-user-needs).

Do research with users to understand the task they are trying to do and how they
navigate through your end-to-end service or product.

#### Link to a different site only if essential

External links connect pages on a website to those on other domains. Use them
only when they are an essential part of the user journey.

Include external links when the user needs:

* to complete their task on an external website
* to access original, authoritative information that’s provided by another government agency or external source.

Follow your agency’s external linking policy when linking to non-government
websites. Avoid implying endorsement to commercial websites in external links.

#### Link to sources instead of duplicating them

When planning content, find out if similar information already exists. If it
does, link to it rather than duplicating it.

Duplicated content is confusing because it’s not clear to the user which page is
the authoritative source. This can cause users to abandon digital services.

Duplicated content also requires resources to maintain, as it can become out of
date easily.

Link directly to the specific page that the user needs to go to, not the
homepage. This is known as ‘deep linking’.

#### Include document title, file type and size when linking to files

Provide content in [HTML format by
default](/format-writing-and-structure/content-formats/reports##consider_publishing_format).
This has benefits for both accessibility and maintenance. If a full HTML version
of the file is not available, link to a summary page if it exists.

There will be some situations in which you need to link to non-HTML documents
and files. Give users the information they need to decide whether to download
the file by providing the:

* document title (not the file name)
* the file type
* the file size in kilobytes (kB) or megabytes (MB).

Include all this information in the link text, but remember that this adds extra
information for all users. Minimise the number of links where you can.

<example>
You can read more about our financial position in the [Digital Transformation Agency Annual Report 2019–20 [PDF 1.96 MB]](https://dta-www-drupal-20180130215411153400000001.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/files/Annual%20reports/dta_Annual_Report_2019-2020_revised.pdf).</example>

You don’t need to explain ‘kB’ and ‘MB’ as they are [units of
measurement](/node/147). ‘PDF’, ‘DOCX’ and other common file types are widely
recognised. If your website uses an unusual or specialist file type, consider
explaining this in your support pages.

##### Take care when using file type icons

For some users, file type icons can be a useful way of recognising different
kinds of files. These icons have disadvantages though:

* File type icons can create ‘clutter’ for users, including those who use assistive technology. This is especially true when there are lists of links.
* File type icons are images and require the same consideration for all [images on websites](/node/49). This includes alternative text.
* File type icons may require resources to apply and maintain. They can be difficult for content authors to use if your content management system does not apply them automatically.
* They may not support the branding or overall look and feel of your site. There is a large variety of icons available and selecting or designing an inappropriate icon may confuse users.

### Write link text that makes the destination clear

Users scan content for links to understand what it is about. People who use
assistive technologies often use the tab key to read from link to link. People
who use screen readers often generate a list of links for quick navigation.

For these reasons, links need to make sense when read out of the context of
surrounding content. Links like ‘click here’ or ‘more information’ don’t give
the user any information about the destination.

Write link text that describes the destination in clear language. Match the
content on the linked page so the user knows they have reached the right place.

<example>
Find out more about our [upcoming events on our Eventbrite
page](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/links).</example>

#### Accessibility requirements

User need:

I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.

Fundamentals:

* Write link text that makes the destination and purpose of the link clear.
* All users must be able to understand the purpose of a link without extra context.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [2.4.4 Link purpose (in context) – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview##link-purpose-in-context)
* [2.4.9 Link purpose (link only) – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=244##link-purpose-link-only)

### Don’t use exit modals

An ‘exit modal’ or ‘exit pop-up’ is an alert that appears on the user’s browser
when they select a link to an external website.

Don’t use these to tell users they are leaving your site when they use external
links. Make it clear in your text that the link is external and explain why you
have included it. These pop-ups interrupt users, overemphasise the transition
and can make users feel lost and confused.

You should also consider developing a policy to explain to users how your site
approaches and presents links to government and non-government content.

### Include keywords at the start of links

People usually only read the first few words of links. Keep them concise and put
the most important words at the start of the link.

Using relevant words at the start of links is called ‘frontloading’.
Frontloading makes it easier for people to scan and find what they’re looking
for. It also helps them to read and assess the link’s relevance.

Write links that are about a single idea, to help people to decide whether to
click. Only link the keywords.

<example>
Attend next month’s Brisbane [workshop for developers and writers](/node/193).</example>

### Put most links at the end of sentences

Links reduce readability because they are distracting. They also make it easy
for users to click away before they have read all your content.

If it’s important for users to understand all your content, put links at the end
of sentences.

If a link makes more sense at the start of a sentence, consider if everything in
the sentence is essential.

<example>
Find out your eligibility for a payment by filling out the [application
form](##).</example>

### Write short calls to action that explain what they do

Use concise keywords for call-to-action text or buttons. Accurately describe
what will happen next.

<example>
[Start your application](##)</example>

### Link email addresses not names

To link to an email address, use the email address as the link text so it’s not
mistaken for a website address.

Use the mailto: prefix in the URL but not in the link text.

<example>
[belinda.bloggs@dta.gov.au](mailto:belinda.bloggs@dta.gov.au)</example>

### Open links in the same browser tab or window

Set links to open in the same browser window or tab by default. This prevents
users from becoming disoriented and allows them to use the ‘back’ button if
needed. This is the default behaviour for links created using the <a> (anchor)
HTML tag.

Consider carefully how users move through your website before you set a link to
open in a new tab or window. Whether a user decides to open a link in a new
browser tab or window depends heavily on the task they are trying to complete.
Some examples are:

* logging on to a secure website
* giving information that would disrupt a multi-step process, such as filling out a form
* downloading a document.

In all cases, give users contextual information in the link to explain why a
link will open in a new window or tab.

### Create internal links that support the user’s journey

Internal links connect pages on the same website. They help users and search
engine find and navigate your content.

Build internal links to help users move through each stage of the user journey.
Use them to help users:

* orient themselves when using your digital product or service
* move sequentially through a step-by-step task
* find information that’s directly related to a topic.

#### Use the same homepage links across the site

You must include a homepage link in your main navigation. This helps users when
they become lost or want to start a new task.

Add homepage links to the agency name or site title and the Commonwealth Coat of
Arms image. Place these links in the top left part of the page.

#### Add in-page links only if they help the user navigate

In-page links (anchor links or bookmark links) connect to content on the same
page. Useful in-page links include:

* tables of contents
* back-to-top links.

In-page links can be helpful when content is lengthy. But they can also be
disorienting if users expect to go to a different page. Test content with users.
Shorter content may better meet their needs.

## Lists

Lists make it easy for users to scan and understand a series of items. Structure
and style lists with the user in mind. Set up grammatical structure for list
items with a lead-in.

### Structure items in a series as a list

Lists are series of items. All lists have a 'lead-in' (a phrase or sentence) or
heading to introduce the list.

Use lists to:

* help users skim information
* group related information
* help users understand how items relate to each other
* show an order of steps
* arrange information by importance.

Lists can be ordered or numbered (the order is important) or unordered (the
order is not critical).

* A bullet list can be ordered or unordered.
* A numbered list is always ordered.

Don’t use a list if you have only one item. Lists are only for a series of
items.

#### Accessibility requirements

User need:

Fundamental requirement: use lists to make it easier for users to skim content
and navigate pages.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criterion: [1.3.1 Info and
relationships – level
A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##info-and-relationships).

#### Make short lists

Long lists can lose meaning and hierarchy, as lower items are further away from
the lead-in.

Move long lists to a separate page or an appendix.

#### Limit the number of lists

Content with too many lists is hard to follow. The content should flow so people
can read it easily.

#### Use a consistent pattern for list items

Write items in a list so they follow a consistent pattern. The pattern is made
up by the number of words you use and grammatical structure.

If items follow a consistent pattern, it makes a list easier to scan and
understand.

### Write list items so they have parallel structure

Write all list items so they have the same grammatical structure. This is called
‘parallel structure’. It makes lists easier to read.

To make a parallel structure, use the same:

* word type to start each item (such as a noun or a verb)
* tense for each item (past, present or future)
* sentence type (such as a question, direction or statement).

Move any words repeated in the list items to the lead-in.

<example>
I will:

* read more emails
* go to meetings
* be punctual.</example>

### Punctuate lists according to style

Unnecessary punctuation makes your list look cluttered. Current government style
is for minimal punctuation.

#### Punctuate lead-ins and headings consistently

Phrase lead-ins always end in a colon (:).

Sentence lead-ins can end in a colon or a full stop. Choose one punctuation mark
and use it for all sentence lead-ins in your document. If in doubt, choose a
colon; it is used more commonly.

Headings do not have punctuation marks.

#### Use minimal punctuation for all lists

In a bullet or numbered list, don’t use:

* semicolons (;) or commas (,) at the end of list items
* ‘and’ or ‘or’ after list items.

Only include ‘and’ or ‘or’ after the second-last list item if it is critical to
meaning – for example, you are writing in a legal context. Make sure the lead-in
is a clear guide for how this kind of list should be interpreted.

Lead-ins for incomplete lists can use ‘for example’, ‘including’ or ‘includes’.

Don’t write ‘etc.’ at the end of the list to show the list is incomplete.

When listing items that may be additional or optional, write a lead-in to
explain any variables.

<example>
Select your preference from one of these options: [Lead-in with many options]

Please write your response to any 3 of the following questions: [Lead-in with a
specific number of options]

Applicants need to choose between either: [Lead-in with a choice between 2
options]</example>

#### Use full stops to complete sentences and fragment lists

Sentence lists and fragment lists are 2 types of list that use full stops.

* Finish each item in a sentence list with a full stop, including the last one.
* Finish fragment lists with a full stop only after the last item.

If you don’t include the full stop, people using screen readers may assume the
next paragraph is part of the list.

A stand-alone list is a third type of list. Stand-alone lists don’t end in a
full stop.

### Choose a type of list

There are different ways to construct a list, whether the list is ordered or
unordered.

Types of list include:

* sentence lists
* fragment lists
* stand-alone lists.

#### Use sentence lists for a series of complete sentences

If you have a paragraph with a series of related sentences, you can consider
breaking it into a sentence list.

Sentence lists have a list of sentences, each marked by bullets or numbers.

The list can have a:

* heading (without a colon or full stop)
* sentence lead-in (ending in a colon or full stop)
* phrase lead-in (ending in a colon).

Rules for sentence lists:

* Follow normal sentence structure in each list item.
* Start each list item with a capital letter and end it with a full stop.
* Align run-over lines with the text, not the bullet or number.

Avoid using multiple sentences in each bullet or numbered item. If you include
more than one sentence per list item, consider whether:

* all list items conform to a similar pattern
* the list builds [rhythm for readability](/node/60##rhythm_changes_can_help_or_hinder_reading).

<example>
Actions for the committee [Heading without a colon before an ordered sentence
list]

1. The secretary will respond to each recommendation.
2. The secretary will allocate responses that need more work to members.
3. Members will discuss the recommendations at the next meeting on 9 March.

The committee members decided on several actions. [Sentence lead-in to a
sentence list, ending in a full stop]

1. The secretary will respond to each recommendation.
2. The secretary will allocate responses that need more work to members.
3. Members will discuss the recommendations at the next meeting on 9 March.</example>

Use full sentence list items for imperative list items where there is no stated
subject in the lead-in.

<example>
To write well:

* Use everyday words.
* Learn about the words people use.
* Choose simple words, not complicated expressions.

[Phrase lead-in to a sentence list, ending in a colon; imperative list items
without a stated subject in the lead-in]</example>

#### Use fragment lists for a series of incomplete sentences

If you list more than 3 items in a sentence, consider breaking the sentence into
a fragment list. This will aid readability.

Fragments are words, phrases or incomplete sentences. Another name for fragment
lists is ‘phrase lists’.

Fragment lists have a:

* lead-in phrase or sentence followed by a colon
* list of fragments, each marked by a bullet.

Use fragment list items when the lead-in states the [grammatical
subject](/node/120##a_full_sentence_is_grammatically_complete).

Rules for fragment lists:

* Use lower case for the first letter of each fragment, unless it’s a proper noun.
* Add a full stop to the last list item only.
* Use a grammatically parallel structure for each list item.
* Make sure each fragment can complete a phrase lead-in.

<example>
Writers should become familiar with the conventional types of content structure:

* hierarchical
* sequential
* narrative.

[Fragment list with a sentence lead-in]</example>

The last rule for fragment lists means that if you add each fragment to a phrase
lead-in, it will make a complete sentence.

If list items run-on from a phrase lead-in, the list should be very short. The
full sentence should be fewer than 25 words.

<example>
Queensland is famous for its:

* islands and coral reefs
* abundant wildlife
* tropical rainforest
* beautiful beaches.

[If you combine the lead-in with each fragment, you make 4 complete sentences:

* Queensland is famous for its islands and coral reefs.
* Queensland is famous for its abundant wildlife.
* Queensland is famous for its tropical rainforest.
* Queensland is famous for its beautiful beaches.]</example>

#### Use stand-alone lists for items under a heading

If you are not breaking up a paragraph or a sentence, consider a stand-alone
list.

Stand-alone lists have a heading without a colon. Brochures and technical
documents often contain stand-alone lists.

Items in stand-alone lists can be nouns or noun phrases. They can also be
sentence fragments. Items cannot be full sentences.

Rules for stand-alone lists:

* Use a heading, not a lead-in.
* Start each list item with a capital letter.
* Don’t add full stops to the end of any of the list items (even the last item).
* Indent each list item if it helps people scan the content.

<example>
**My weekly tasks**

* Answer phone enquiries
* Book conference venues
* Order stationery
* Take meeting minutes</example>

The differences between a fragment list and a stand-alone list are:

* A fragment list has a sentence or phrase lead-in.
* A stand-alone list has no lead-in, only a heading.
* Fragment list items complete phrase lead-ins to form a grammatical sentence.
* Stand-alone list items do not form a grammatical sentence.

### Use consistent formatting for all lists

Sometimes you need to use different types of lists in the same piece of content.

Use the right punctuation and capital letters for each type of list.

Follow your organisation’s templates to format lists consistently.

#### Indent most lists

Indent most types of lists after the lead-in.

Indent stand-alone lists if it helps the user scan the list.

#### Aim to write lists that conform to their type

Consistency helps people scan lists.

Ideally, lists of the same type should follow the same format, particularly when
they appear close together in your content. For example, a fragment list should
look the same as other fragment lists.

However, the nature of content means this is not always possible. For example,
the logical flow of text can mean that some sentence lists work best with a
sentence lead-in and others with a fragment lead-in.

Do your best to standardise. But if you can’t, do these things for consistency:

* For sentence lists, choose one type of punctuation to end any sentence lead-ins – a colon or a full stop.
* For stand-alone lists, follow the same format for all list items – with indent/bullets or without indent/bullets.
* Don’t mix different types of lists in the one list.
* Follow all other rules for lists on this page.

Then check that your lists display properly on all platforms.

### Write numbered lists if the order is critical

Use a numbered (ordered) list when the order is important, such as a list of
instructions.

Sometimes you have more than one numbered list in the document. You must choose
whether to continue or reset the numbering across the lists.

<example>
How to register for the conference:

1. Choose the days you will attend.
2. Pick the workshops you want to join.
3. Enter your discount code (if you have one).

[This list is numbered because users must complete each step in turn.]</example>

#### Avoid using in-line numbered lists

Break up text into a numbered list instead of using an in-line numbered list.
This will aid readability.

<example>
The facilitator will:

1. welcome participants to the conference
2. introduce each of the speakers.

[A numbered list]</example>

To order points in general content, don’t use [ordinal numbers](/node/162).
Instead, you can either:

* use a numbered list
* rephrase the sentences to link them in the same paragraph.

<example>
The facilitator will welcome participants to the conference. Next, they will
introduce each of the speakers.

[The sentences are linked as a sequence with ‘next’ (an [adverb](/node/127)).]</example>

#### Put unordered lists in a sequence that helps the user

Use an unordered list if the order is not critical to understanding the content.

List items in the order that will make sense to the user reading it. It’s common
to write lists in alphabetical order.

<example>
**National parks near Perth**

* Avon Valley National Park
* Serpentine National Park
* Walyunga National Park
* Yanchep National Park

[This stand-alone list uses an alphabetical order, which is easy for users to
follow. Context might give you a reason to use a different order for the same
list of national parks. For example, you could also sort them by proximity to
Perth.]</example>

### Avoid using a multilevel list

Multilevel lists group information into a hierarchy. The levels explain how each
item relates to other list items.

Some types of content need multilevel lists, but they can be hard for people to
follow.

If you have to use multilevel lists:

* Don’t use more than 2 levels.
* Use lowercase letters for the second level in a numbered list.
* Use a dash for the second level in a bullet list, not hollow (open) bullets.
* Use the same symbol, number or letter for the same level in each list.

<example>
There are many types of birds in Australia, including:

* nocturnal birds– frogmouths– nightjars– owls
* marsh birds– crakes– grebes– snipes.

[A multilevel (bullet) list, using a dash for the second level]</example>

## Paragraphs

One topic per paragraph helps users absorb information. Organise them under
headings to help users scan the content. Write short paragraphs, each starting
with a topic sentence or a transition sentence.

### Limit each paragraph to one topic

People find it easier to understand content when a paragraph contains only one
topic or theme. Don’t introduce a new topic in the middle or at the end of a
paragraph. Start a new paragraph instead.

Introduction or summary paragraphs recap ideas covered in the content. Group
sentences in these paragraphs by theme – for example, to help users
understand [how the content is structured](/node/75).

### Put paragraphs in the order that makes sense to the user

Order paragraphs in a logical sequence, such as:

* steps in a transaction
* the order of importance
* cause then effect
* problem then solution
* pros then cons.

This helps people follow related ideas or [steps in a sequence](/node/78).

Arrange paragraphs under brief, meaningful
[headings](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/headings).
Headings help users understand what the paragraphs cover.

### Expand on the heading in the first paragraph

The first paragraph under a heading helps people decide if they’ve found the
information they need. Search engines also use first paragraphs when analysing
content.

Use the first paragraph to make the purpose of your content easier to find in
[searches](/node/72). It should include a topic sentence and summarise the
following paragraphs.

You can use first paragraphs to improve long-form content, such as reports.
First paragraphs can summarise the main points in each section.

Copy and paste all the first paragraphs together to compile a summary of your
content. If you’re missing any main points, rewrite some of your first
paragraphs.

### Structure each paragraph well

The first sentence in each paragraph should be a topic or transition sentence. A
topic sentence tells people what the paragraph is about. A transition sentence
explicitly connects the previous paragraph with the new.

Each paragraph should contain sentences that are arranged logically and relate
only to the topic.

A paragraph’s concluding sentence usually summarises the topic or leads into the
next paragraph.

#### Topic sentences

Most paragraphs will begin with a topic sentence. When users skim content, topic
sentences help them to follow your meaning.

To write an effective topic sentence, use [active
voice](/node/204##write_in_active_voice). This approach makes the topic of the
paragraph the [grammatical subject of the topic
sentence](/node/120##passive_voice_changes_standard_sentence_order).

<example>
Our rapid response team began operating in 2019 as a result of the 2018
stakeholder survey. The survey showed it took too long to repair damage.</example>

#### Transition sentences

You can also choose to start a paragraph with a transition sentence. The
transition sentence includes words that link the topic of the previous paragraph
with the topic to follow. This is particularly useful when the concluding
sentence of one paragraph doesn’t explicitly link to the next.

Transition sentences are also useful if it's important to stress that your new
paragraph is part of a larger narrative. Transition sentences keep the narrative
flowing and help users make connections.

<example>
* … In summary, an effective policy strategy understands public needs, the purpose of the strategy and the desired strategic outcome. [Concluding sentence of paragraph 1]
* To build on a robust policy strategy, it’s essential to evaluate and measure outcomes after implementation. Analyse performance metrics and gather user feedback regularly. And stay responsive: keep informed about societal trends and adapt where necessary … [Transition sentence begins paragraph 2]</example>

#### Be clear when using pronouns to start paragraphs

Take care if you start a paragraph with a [pronoun](/node/131). It should
already be clear who or what the pronoun is referring to. If not, make sure to
mention the noun in each paragraph before using the pronoun that substitutes the
[noun](/node/122).

<example>
The initial amounts for appropriation in 2019–20 were up to:

* $295 million for ordinary annual services
* $380 million for other annual services.

The appropriations increased in March 2020 to account for unforeseen
expenditures in relation to COVID-19.

[The new paragraph clearly states what increased in March 2020: ‘the
appropriations’.]</example>

### Keep most paragraphs to 2 or 3 sentences

Short paragraphs help people understand content. The ideal length depends on
what you are writing, for example:

* Media releases and news articles have 1 or 2 sentences in a paragraph.
* Content designed for mobile screens has no more than 2 or 3 sentences in a paragraph.
* Reports (and other long-form content) usually have a limit of 6 sentences in a paragraph.

If your paragraphs or sentences are too long, you might be trying to say too
much in one place.

Consider starting a new paragraph or using an [itemised list](/node/56). Make
sure the items relate to each other and are grammatically parallel.

A paragraph can be one sentence, but be careful. Overusing single-sentence
paragraphs reduces their effectiveness and can disrupt the flow of content.

#### Digital Service Standard requirements

Use responsive design methods to make sure users can read the content on any
device. Short paragraphs are critical in responsive design: [Criterion 6.
Consistent and responsive
design](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/6-consistent-and-responsive-design).

Many people do not use a desktop computer or printed material to access
government services and information. Test your content on a mobile device first.

### Write clear sentences using fewer than 25 words

All sentences should use [plain
language](/node/204##write_plain_language_sentences). Even in technical
documents, keep sentences to fewer than 25 words. Long sentences often cause
long paragraphs.

Sentences in a paragraph develop the main idea from a topic or
transition sentence by:

* giving examples or details
* comparing or contrasting
* showing cause and effect
* drawing conclusions from evidence.

In complex content, you might need to use a paragraph or more for each of these
points.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

I can read and understand text, even if the content includes unusual words and
shortened forms, or features languages other than English.

Fundamentals:

* Write in plain language. This helps all users and is essential for some.
* Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases, idioms and so on. Expand all acronyms on their first use.
* Avoid using double negatives.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:[3.1.5 Reading level –
level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##reading-level). Level AAA
requires a lower secondary education reading level, after removal of proper
names and titles, ([year 7 or between 12 and 14 years
old](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/node/62##literacy_affects_access_to_government_services_and_information)).

## Tables

Tables provide a structure for complex and detailed information. Design
accessible tables and organise data so it’s easy for users to scan.

### Use tables if they make content easier to read

Use a table only if there isn’t a simpler way to present your content, such as a
list, paragraph of text or diagram.

Use tables for exact values and information that is too detailed for the text.

Don’t create a table for only one or 2 items. Report them in the body of the
text instead.

Design tables to allow users to:

* scan the information
* find an exact value
* compare values in different categories
* understand how you have categorised the information.

Don’t make tables with other tables inside them (known as ‘nested’ tables).

Some people will look at tables before they read the text. For this reason,
design tables so they are self-explanatory. You must still refer to the table in
the body of the text. Place the table immediately after the reference to it in
the text.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can change the content without losing information or structure.
* I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.

Fundamentals:

* Tables can be made accessible for all users. The World Wide Web Consortium has [tips for setting up tables](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/tips/).
* You must give a table:- a title (also called a [caption](/node/49))- row and column headings- information (entries)- a cross-reference in the text.
* You may also need to add notes below the table to help users understand the information and where it comes from.
* Don’t rely on colour as the only visual means of conveying information in tables.
* Don’t leave cells empty. Use ‘zero’ or ‘nil’ or 'n/a' where there is no data. If it is numeric data, use the numeric zero (0). Only use zero if that is the true value.

WCAG quick reference:

* [1.3.1 Info and relationships – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##info-and-relationships)
* [1.4.1 Use of color – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##use-of-color)

#### Print considerations

Publish long and detailed tables separately or in an appendix.

### Refer to the table in the text

Tables support the discussion in the text, not the other way around. It is
essential to refer to a table in the text.

A single table on a webpage does not need a table number. If you use tables
repeatedly, number tables and include the table number when you refer to the
table in the text.

When using a table:

* Place the table close to where you mention it in the text and after the paragraph that refers to it. In print, the table should be on the same or facing page.
* Ensure that the table number referenced in the text matches the table number in the title.
* Don’t repeat the whole title of the table in the text.
* Don’t refer to ‘the table below’ or ‘the table above’.
* Ensure that the information in the text is consistent with the information in the table.

Your text comments on or interprets the table. Where possible, avoid repeating
the text or data in the table word for word.

<example>

#### Write

Table 2 shows that average rainfall has …</example>

#### Print considerations

Avoid referring to a page number in the text. Page numbers can change during the
publishing process.

### Limit tables to only the information the user needs

Be informative, but don’t include too much information. Use only as much text or
data as you need to make sure the table is easy to understand. Make sure
information is:

* precise
* relevant to the title or caption
* from a credible source and backed by evidence
* consistent with how it’s presented in the text.

Check text and data in the table against the same information in the body of
your content. It is easy to make a last-minute change to one and forget to
correct the other.

### Place data in a consistent and sequential order

Ensure that information in the table is correctly grouped and sits under the
correct headings. The text or data in a table should use the same grammatical
form (for example, [noun](/node/122), [noun phrase](/node/144) or
[sentence](/node/204)).

Organise data in a sequential order. For example, order a list of names
alphabetically by family name.

Merged cells can reduce usability for many people, including screen reader
users. They can be made accessible in HTML and PDF. Avoid using them in word
processing applications.

To design usable tables:

* Don’t make tables too long or too wide.
* Consider splitting a large, complex table into smaller tables.
* If the content includes a large number of tables, consider putting them in an appendix.
* Check the structure and content of all the tables in your content. If you repeat or duplicate information, combine or delete tables.

### Set column and row headings that are clear and accurate

Use simple language in row and column headings for tables. This makes it easier
for people to understand the information. It also helps screen reader
users navigate tables.

Structure tables so:

* the first row contains the column headings
* the first column (also known as the ‘stub’) contains the row headings.

The column and row headings must relate to each other so users can make sense of
the information.

Mark up tables to show header cells and data cells. PDF software and web
authoring programs have tools to help you with this.

Use the same grammatical form for each entry in a column.

#### Complex tables

Complex tables have header cells that span more than one column or row. If you
use a complex table, you must define the column and row groups and mark up the
table accordingly. This is so screen reader users can access the information in
the table.

For detailed instructions and tutorials, visit:

* W3C’s web accessibility tutorial ‘[Tables with irregular headers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/irregular/)’
* Adobe’s [PDF accessibility repair: examine and repair tables](https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/acrobat/pdf-repair-repair-tables.html).

##### Print considerations

If a table runs over pages when printed, ensure:

* column headings appear at the top of each page
* you repeat row headings on each page.

### Add notes to provide sources or help interpret the data

The notes below a table can apply to the whole table or a specific entry in the
table.

Use notes to tell users:

* how to interpret information in the table
* what the source of the information in the table is.

Don’t include this information in the table title or caption or in ordinary
footnotes or endnotes.

To connect the note under the table to the information it refers to in the table
use:

* a symbol such as an asterisk (\*) or hash (##) for only one note
* superscript numbers or letters for more than one note.

Use only one type of note in a table. Either use all symbols, all superscript
numbers or all superscript letters.

When writing table notes, list them in the following order:

1. abbreviations
2. notes to superscript locators
3. general note to the table
4. source of data (use the appropriate form for [author–date](/node/165) or [documentary–note](/node/166)).

Align notes to the left. They should not extend beyond the edges of the table.
Don’t use superscript for the note identifiers (the symbol, number or letter) in
the note. They should be the same font size as the text of the notes so that
they are easily found.

#### Copyright requirements

You must [attribute copyright material](/node/181) you reference. This includes
data tables.

Read the government copyright rules in the [Australian Government intellectual
property
manual](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

### Scan-read table data and text for alignment

The text and data in a table are as important as the structure. Align data and
text so the table is easy to scan.

In general:

* Align text to the left.
* Align numbers to the right.

In addition, decimal points in the column should line up.

Text should be set horizontally so it is easy to read. Don’t rotate text to
display vertically.

If you can, use a fixed-width font for numbers in columns to help users scan the
column and compare the values.

For column and row headings:

* Align column headings with the content in the column.
* Include the unit in the heading if it is not in the title or caption.
* Left-align row headings.

#### Print considerations

Choose a clear typeface in a smaller point size than the text.

Don’t use a point size that is too small. Although typefaces and sizes vary,
anything smaller than 8 points is too small.

Try to keep tables on one page. If you must use a long table:

* omit the rule at the bottom of the table – this is a visual cue that the table is not complete
* at the bottom of the table, insert ‘(continued)’ aligned right to the edge of the table
* on the next page, repeat the caption and insert ‘(continued)’ after the table number – for example, ‘Table 3 (continued): Farm output from 1990 to 2000’.

### Use lines and contrast to help readability

Design tables for readability.

* Don’t use colour as the only way to convey meaning.
* Don’t use cell or text formatting to convey meaning. It can make the table difficult to read. Screen reader users cannot ‘see’ the formatting.
* Use lines where they help people read the table. Short tables need only a line above and below the header row and at the bottom of the table. Longer tables need lines, or shading of alternate rows (zebra shading), to help people follow the alignment across the table.
* Ensure there is not too much white space between columns. This makes the content harder to read.
* A table will take up the full width of the screen when viewed on a mobile phone. This may change the white space between columns and make it more or less readable.

A key benefit of tables is that they help people compare information. This is
possible only if tables look the same as one another. Use the same font, and
font sizes, rule (line) thicknesses and colour schemes for tables throughout the
document.

### Provide a summary for complex tables

For complex tables, provide a summary to give people who use screen readers an
overview of the information in the table.

The summary does not provide the same information as the title or caption.

Examples of summaries and captions and how to include them in HTML are in [W3C’s
caption and
summary tutorial](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/caption-summary/).

A summary can include a brief description of what:

* is in the rows and columns
* is being measured and the units of measurements
* the relationship between rows and columns is.

## Text boxes and callouts

Text boxes, pull-quotes and sidebars draw attention from body text. Make sure
they are accessible to everyone.

### Limit the use of text boxes and callouts

You can draw attention to information in content by using text boxes and
callouts (pull-quotes and sidebars).

Before you include a text box or callout in your content, consider how it will
help people understand or use the information.

Don’t overuse text boxes or callouts: they become a distraction. Avoid
putting content in a text box or callout just because you can’t make it fit into
the flow of the text.

#### Text boxes

Text boxes sit close to the text they support.

Text boxes should contain a summary, examples or an expansion of ideas in the
body of the text. This is because people:

* scan text boxes before they read the body text
* often read text boxes separately from the main body of the text.

Use text boxes to set information apart from the content. You can use text boxes
for information that is useful but not part of the main content, for example:

* summaries
* checklists
* examples
* case studies
* quotes
* links to related information
* definitions.

#### Pull-quotes

Pull-quotes are a type of callout. They are often in the form of an incomplete
quote and are set apart with distinct formatting. They are not the same as
‘[block
quotations](/node/114##format_long_quotes_as_block_quotes_with_no_quotation_marks)’.

Pull-quotes are a device to draw the user back into the content.

<example> 
‘engaging with the user is vital in government content’

</example>

#### Sidebars

Sidebars are a type of callout. They sit beside the main content and are more
common in print publications.

### Use text boxes for supporting content, not main text
Text boxes do more than highlight information. They also make it clear that it
shouldn’t be read as part of the main text.

Use the same presentation for the same type of content. For example, present
example text boxes consistently, but differently to summary information.

Use the same rules for capitalisation, punctuation and lists as other text.

Longer text boxes should have a heading or title to show people the purpose of
the text box at a glance. Make it distinct from the other headings in the text
so you don’t interrupt the [heading
hierarchy](/node/51##organise_heading_levels_in_a_logical_order).

In technical or long-form content, text boxes often contain short articles that
support the main body of the text. Examples include case studies and
descriptions of processes. They often contain [images](/node/46).

Number text boxes if they feature repeatedly in content. Refer to numbered text
boxes in the body text. You can use an appropriate identifier, such as ‘Box
1’ or ‘Case study 1’.

### Make text boxes accessible in HTML

Make sure boxes are readable by all users and on all devices.

For text boxes in HTML, use the <aside> element.

You can also use the <role=“complementary”> attribute to define an ARIA
complementary landmark. Use this when it sits outside the <main> content.

Alternatively, use the <role=“region”> attribute and assign a name if the
content needs to sit within the <main> section of a page.

For more information about formatting, visit the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) [ARIA landmarks
example](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/landmarks/complementary.html).

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.
* I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.

Fundamentals:

* Organise content in a clear order using section headings.
* Choose colours and fonts that are readable. The design must be able to work well on mobile devices.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [1.3.1 Info and relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=131##info-and-relationships) [–](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##section-headings)[level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=131##info-and-relationships)

* [2.4.10 Section headings – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##section-headings)

### Don’t use text boxes in Microsoft Office documents

You should not use text boxes in Word and PowerPoint. They are not accessible
for most users of screen readers.

In Word, text boxes can sit above or below the ‘document layer’ that contains
the page text – they are floating objects that can't carry a semantic structure.
These features mean that not everyone using a screen reader can:

* read floating objects
* understand how box text relates to page text
* read the box text and page text in the correct order.

Instead of text boxes, use borders and paragraph styles to highlight content
visually. If these styles don't work for your content, there are other
solutions.

A one-by-one table is an option. If your document has complex formatting,
[accessible PDF (Portable Document
Format)](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/format-writing-and-structure/content-formats/pdf-portable-document-format##make_pdf_content_accessible_to_all_users)
might be a better option.

Complex Office documents require careful design. To ensure accessibility, get
advice from an accessibility professional.

## Types of structure

Structure supports the user as they search for information. Use the type of
structure that suits the content and how people will need to consume it.

### Structure content to help the user to navigate and understand

Structure helps [people find information](/node/74). It helps people to
understand and use content by:

* preparing them for what they will read
* helping them navigate and scan content
* helping them remember what they’ve read.

Structure also helps [search engines](/node/72). They use structure to find and
rank content in a search results listing.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.
* I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.

Fundamentals:

* Write clear page titles. The title is the first thing a screen reader user will hear and is the first item to appear in search results.
* Organise content in a clear order using section headings. Describe the topics or the following section in the headings.
* Make sure all users can navigate through all content in the intended order, regardless of the technology they're using. Use the same navigation elements across services.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [1.3.1 Info and relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=121%2C128%2C131%2C136%2C413%2C1411##info-and-relationships) [–](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##section-headings) [level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=121%2C128%2C131%2C136%2C413%2C1411##info-and-relationships)

* [2.4.10 Section headings – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##section-headings)

### Pick the type of structure that works for the user

Use a structure that matches expectations for the type of content you're
creating:

* To group content into topics or connected ideas, prioritised by level of importance, use a [hierarchical structure](/node/79). People will scan content for relevance to them. Some will use screen readers to list headings in order to understand the content at a high level. Hierarchical structure is economical for people with low attention span, who are time-poor or need to use assistive technologies.
* To present a sequence of steps or events, use a [sequential structure](/node/78). People will need to know or do something with the content that is presented as instructional and ordered. Sequential structure helps people know where they are in a process towards a given result.
* To guide people from beginning to end, use a [narrative structure](/node/80). People will be interested in knowing the entire story. They will expect signposts that suggest where they are in the journey for ease of reference.

Avoid unconventional or inconsistent structures. They make people work harder to
find and understand content. Do user research to understand who will be using
the content and their [level of literacy](/node/62).

Your organisation might have templates for content such as [reports](/node/47),
[letters and emails](/node/50). Structural elements are built into those
templates.

### Design headings and other elements to help the user scan the page

Once you have decided on the type of structure you need to use, plan the
structural elements.

* Use a logical hierarchy or sequential steps for [headings](/node/51).
* Write a topic sentence for each [paragraph](/node/53).
* Display important information in [lists](/node/56), [callout boxes](/node/58), [tables](/node/45) and [illustrations](/node/46).

Structure your content by writing about one idea at a time:

* Start with the most important idea first.
* Group related ideas under [headings](/node/51).
* Organise ideas into short [paragraphs](/node/53).
* Make sure ideas flow from one paragraph to the next.
* Use a logical order for [sentences](/node/120).

## Hierarchical structure

A hierarchy sorts content into categories and levels. This structure can give
users a picture of how items or topics fit together.

### Show how categories relate to one another

Hierarchies structure content by category. They show how different categories
relate to each other, and how they relate to the main idea or theme.

This structure is the basis for the information architecture of many websites.
It also suits organisational charts and other visual content that ranks items in
a hierarchy of relationships.

To structure content hierarchically:

* Plan the [headings](/node/51).
* Decide what information fits under each heading.
* Plan subheadings.
* Keep the hierarchy shallow – use no more than 4 heading levels.
* Check the headings for consistency and logic.

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.
* I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.

Fundamentals:

* Write clear page titles. The title is the first thing a screen reader user will hear and is the first item to appear in search results.
* Organise content in a clear order using section headings. Describe the topics or the following section in the headings.
* Make sure all users can navigate through all content in the intended order, regardless of the technology they're using. Use the same navigation elements across services.

* [2.4.10 Section headings – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##section-headings)

## Inverted pyramid structure

The inverted pyramid starts with what the user most needs to know. Order the
rest of the page from most to least important information.

### Use the inverted pyramid for most content

The basic structure of the inverted pyramid is:

* a heading
* details in order, from the most to the least important.

The most important idea comes first or ‘above the fold’. This is the top part of
a screen or a newspaper, where people can see the main idea at a glance.

This structure helps users scan content on any device. It also helps [optimise
the page for search engines](/node/103).

<example> 
         An inverted pyramid is a structure for a piece of content: important detail comes first  </example>

### Start with what the user most needs to know

To structure your content as an inverted pyramid:

* Write the main idea in as few words as possible. It can be a summary, a conclusion or recommendation, or the action someone needs to take.
* Describe the main ideas in [headings](/node/51).
* Under each of the top-level headings, group the content under [subheadings](/node/51##organise_headings_in_a_logical_order). This helps people find supporting information.
* Write supporting [paragraphs](/node/53).
* Organise the information in order of importance.

For long-form content, use a summary or a list of recommendations in the
preliminary pages. This helps people read the main information with ease.

### Design pages based on how the user scans

People start at the top of a page and decide within seconds whether to go past
the initial view.

The headline and the first few lines provide the main reason for staying (or
leaving). As people read through the content, they might also scan pictures or
other headings, but they could also stop reading at any time.
The inverted pyramid works because people pay more attention when they first see
the content. Their interest tends to wane in the middle, and sometimes they
never reach the end. Journalists know that’s how readers behave and structure
content accordingly.

To structure a paragraph using the inverted pyramid, start with a topic
sentence. Use the rest of the paragraph to explain the topic sentence.

## Narrative structure

Narrative structure can suit long-form content, like technical writing or
academic journals. Users expect a beginning, middle and end.

### Use narrative structure for long-form content

Narrative structure is common in reports, books and technical writing. It
generally works better for long-form content than it does for digital content in
HTML. This structure is used with some success in long-form [blogs](/node/44).

Narrative structure starts with general statements about the topic. The middle
explains or discusses new ideas. The conclusion summarises the main ideas and
makes recommendations.

This structure can cause people to miss important ideas:

* The main points are not easy to find.
* People usually need to read from beginning to end to understand the context, even if there is only one main thing they need from the content.

To help users, you can summarise the main findings in the introduction.

### Write a beginning, middle and end

Narrative structure has:

* a beginning – the introduction
* a middle – the arguments, discussions and explanations
* an end – conclusion or recommendations.

Signpost each part with [headings](/node/51).

Academic writing also uses this structure. It starts with an introduction,
followed by the methods, a discussion and conclusion.

An abstract summarises the article in many academic [journals](/node/57). People
tend to read the abstract and the conclusion of a research paper first, before
they decide if they want to read the whole paper.

## Sequential structure

Sequential structure follows a clear order to make it easy for users to follow
step by step. It can suit instructions or a report of an event.

### Use a sequential structure to explain steps or a specific order

A sequential structure shows a process, a series of steps or an order of events.

Use a sequential structure for:

* instructions – such as how-to guides, recipes and directions
* step-by-step content formats – such as forms
* reports of events – such as incident reports, histories and case studies.

This type of structure helps users understand how items in the sequence relate
to each other.

Use the right writing style. For example, instructions and transactions are more
direct and use the [imperative](/node/128). Reports of events usually use the
[past tense of the verb](/node/128).

<example> 
##### Instructions

Complete step 1 before moving to step 2. [The verb ‘complete’ is in the
imperative mood.]

##### Incident report

The support worker placed the transfer board under the client’s left upper leg.
[The verb 'placed' is in the past tense.]

</example>

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.
* I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.

Fundamentals:

* Write clear page titles. The title is the first thing a screen reader user will hear and is the first item to appear in search results.
* Order the content in a sequence that is meaningful for the user.
* Organise content in a clear order using section headings. Describe the topics or the following section in the headings.
* Make sure all users can navigate through all content in the intended order, regardless of the technology they're using. Use the same navigation elements across services.

* [2.4.10 Section headings – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##section-headings)

### Split processes into balanced steps

Dividing a process into a sequence of steps can be challenging. Create the right
number of steps.

* Too few steps might mean you have left out important information or grouped too many actions under one heading.
* Too many steps might mean you have divided the process into steps so small they are meaningless.

If the process is very complex, group steps into broader stages of the process.

The broad stages can fit into a higher-level sequential structure, or into
topics using a [hierarchical structure](/node/79). This combination of
structures can help users revisit a topic.

If you use a combination of structures, design menu and link items based on [how
users find their way through the
content](/node/74##learn_how_users_search_for_information). Be consistent in the
language, style and design of headings at the same level across the content.

For example, in a course registration process, a student might decide to choose
a different course session after entering their personal details. Start with the
most important information – the course selection – so people don’t waste time
trying to find it.

<example> 
Course options

1. Select the course
2. Select the session

Personal details

1. Enter your name
2. Enter your contact details
3. Enter any dietary requirements

Payment

1. Select the payment method
2. Enter details
3. Select submit
4. Print the receipt
</example>

### Write clear instructions users can follow

For instructional and transactional content, people want to know what they need
to do. They don’t need long explanations of the process.

If an explanation is needed, consider:

* how you can help people keep their focus
* what the minimum amount of information is
* whether a link would be more useful.

If users need a lot of extra information to do a task, you might have tried to
include too much in a single step. You need to break the task into smaller
steps.

## Plain language and word choice

Plain language can express complex ideas. Engage people with words they can
understand quickly: use the list on this page. Clarify expressions people might
be unfamiliar with.

### Use everyday words

Choose words that people are familiar with. Unfamiliar words make content harder
to read and understand.

<example> 
Email your receipt by 5 pm today to claim the prize.

#### Accessibility requirements

User need:

I can read and understand text, even if the content includes unusual words and
shortened forms, or features languages other than English.

Fundamentals:

* Write in plain language. This helps all users and is essential for some.
* Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases, idioms and so on. Expand all acronyms on their first use.
* Avoid using double negatives.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [3.1.5 Reading level](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##reading-level) [–](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##unusual-words) [level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##reading-level). Level AAA requires a lower secondary education reading level, after removal of proper names and titles, ([year 7 or between 12 and 14 years old](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/node/62##literacy_affects_access_to_government_services_and_information))

#### Use ‘we’, ‘you’ and ‘us’ if you can

Use personal pronouns (like ‘we’, ‘you’, ‘us’) when it suits the voice and tone.

A direct, active [voice and tone helps to engage users](/node/40). Active voice
and tone makes it clear who must do what.

<example> 
We will assess your application within 30 days. [Active voice makes who is doing
what clear. Personal pronouns ‘we’ and ‘your’ support a direct tone.]

</example>

#### Avoid jargon

Remove jargon, slang and idioms.

<example> 
They changed their decision in response to new information.

</example>

#### Use inclusive language

People can relate to content when it uses [inclusive language](/node/178).
Choose words that respect all people, including their rights and their heritage.

### Learn about the words people use

Find out if your word choice matches the words people will use to find the
content. What is obvious to you might not be obvious to them.

Including the everyday words and phrases you discover also helps people
understand your content. People engage more readily with familiar language.

You can build insight through [user research and content testing](/node/76). For
example, you can check whether:

* you are using unfamiliar jargon
* you need to highlight unfamiliar concepts and explain them.

Check search engine analytics for terms people are using to find related content
online. You can discover useful search terms and [keywords to include in search
engine optimisation](/node/72).

### Choose simple words, not complicated expressions

There is usually more than one way to express something. Find the simplest,
clearest option.

Replace longer words and phrases with simpler alternatives. You can use this

### Keep words and phrases with special meaning to a minimum

People can be unfamiliar with words you need to use, for example:

* [official titles](/node/149)
* [Acts of parliament](/node/208)
* [names of organisations](/node/88).

For names and terms with special meaning, follow [style rules and
conventions](/node/117). This helps users scan content.

Be selective about shortened forms, such as [abbreviations](/node/184),
[contractions](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/contractions),
[acronyms and initialisms](/node/190).

Some shortened forms are better-known than the full form of the term, for
example ‘DNA’. Check a dictionary to see if the acronym or initialism is listed.

Shorten only the words and phrases that are well known or used many times in
your content. Shortened forms can help people read and understand content, but
too many can be difficult to keep track of.

Spell them out the first time you use them.

<example> 
The Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) helps government agencies create digital
services.

</example>

Shortened forms can be a type of jargon that is not suitable in plain language
content. Try to avoid them altogether if they are used only once or twice.

You can include technical or specialist terms if your research shows your
audience uses them. But start with plain language words as the default to keep
the reading level accessible. [Plain language helps
everyone](/node/62##simple_content_helps_all_users).

To help people understand specialist or technical content:

* explain terms – for example, use a glossary
* include a short summary without using specialist terms.

In content with many specialist terms, reserve shortened forms for the most
frequently used terms only. Spell out other terms in full.

## Sentences

Clear sentences in active voice improve readability. Keep sentences short to
help people scan content.

### Write plain language sentences

Standard English sentences are built on [subject–verb–object
order](/node/120##a_full_sentence_is_grammatically_complete). This structure
forms the basis of plain language writing.

Keep sentences to an average of 15 words and no more than 25 words, especially
for digital content. Too many words, phrases and clauses affect people’s ability
to [scan sentences](/node/60##complex_sentences_are_hard_to_read).

Sometimes it’s hard to avoid longer sentences – for example, if you have to
include a long department name. Sentences over 25 words can usually be broken up
using different techniques, like [using lists](/node/56).

#### Accessibility requirements

User need:

I can read and understand text, even if the content includes unusual words and
shortened forms, and features languages other than English.

Fundamentals:

* Write in plain language. This helps all users and is essential for some.
* Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases, idioms and so on. Expand all acronyms on their first use.
* Avoid using double negatives.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criterion: [3.1.5 Reading level –
level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##reading-level). Level AAA
requires a lower secondary education reading level, after removal of proper
names and titles ([year 7 or between 12 and 14 years old](/node/62)).

### Use active voice

Use active rather than [passive
voice](/node/120##passive_voice_changes_standard_sentence_order). Active voice
helps users understand who is doing what. It can also help people know exactly
what their responsibility is.

<example> 
* Eligible students can access the subsidy by completing the application. [Active voice]
* The subsidy can be accessed by completing the application. [Passive voice]
</example>

The difference is clearest with [action
verbs](/node/128##verbs_describe_an_action_a_state_an_event_or_a_change):

* Active voice: the grammatical subject is performing the action in a sentence.
* Passive voice: the grammatical subject is undergoing the action.

<example> 
* Active voice: The student filed the application. [‘The student’ is the grammatical subject, who did the filing. ‘The application’ is the object.]
* Passive voice: The application was filed by the student. [‘The application’ is the grammatical subject, but did not do the filing.]
</example>

### Construct positive, unambiguous sentences

Words, phrases and sentences can have more than one meaning. Write exactly what
you mean and construct your sentences so there is no ambiguity.

<example> 
The graduate with a broken leg sat at the desk. [The graduate has a broken leg.]

</example>

Write sentences so they are positive rather than negative.

<example> 
Include these documents when you apply.

</example>

#### Avoid double negatives

Double negatives can lead to misunderstandings, so avoid them.

<example> 
It was acceptable …

</example>

### Eliminate unnecessary words

Make each word work for its place in the sentence. Sentence structure is clearer
if each word plays a necessary role. Clear sentences improve readability.

It helps to test the combination to know which words are necessary.

Keep the words that play a critical function in the sentence. Remove all the
words except the [subject, verb and object (if
applicable)](/node/120##a_full_sentence_is_grammatically_complete). 

Check if the sentence is grammatically correct when you remove the other words.

Build the sentence back together, leaving out any words that aren’t absolutely
necessary. Adverbs and adjectives are usually good candidates to leave out in
this kind of test.

Check if the basic meaning of the sentence remains, and if it’s grammatical.
Then check if the words you’ve removed are really working to keep their place.

<example> 
We provide statistics for trade reports. Contact us with trade data requests and
we’ll respond within 2 business days.

[This is concise text that communicates relevant and necessary information. It
uses 19 words.]

</example>

Testing combinations as you write will also help create concise and easily
understood headings, fragment lists and descriptive links.

Word combinations affect punctuation, spelling, capitalisation and formatting.
For example, there are rules about the [use of commas between
adjectives](/node/126##there_is_a_common_order_for_strings_of_adjectives) and the
[use of hyphens between adverbs and
verbs](/node/105##dont_hyphenate_ing_and_ed_verbs_or_most_ly_adverbs).

Check guidance about [types of words and their function](/node/203). This
guidance relates closely to other style rules in [grammar, punctuation and
conventions](/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions).

#### Be precise

Avoid unnecessary words. Keep the words needed to make meaning clear.

<example> 
Call us if you have any questions.

</example>

Avoid using ‘there is’ and ‘there are’ when they only add extra words and not
meaning.

<example> 
If anything doesn’t fit within this framework ...

</example>

### Vary sentence structure

Vary your sentence structure to suit the content.

Sentence structures can be [simple, compound or
complex](/node/120##sentences_are_simple_compound_or_complex). This depends on
the number of clauses they contain and [how clauses work together](/node/143).

Simple sentence structures are easier to scan. People understand meaning through
the order of words in a sentence. A simple sentence construction has fewer parts
to take in.

Compound and complex sentences can add variety and flow to your writing.
Sentences should still be easy to scan, even using these structures.

Complex structure is harder to follow, regardless of a person’s literacy level.
Complex structures take more effort to read, even if they are punctuated
properly.

<example> 
 

You can delete your application within an hour of applying.

[‘Within an hour of applying’ modifies the main clause.]

</example>

### Build simple phrases and clauses

Sentences consist of [phrases](/node/144) and [clauses](/node/143). Each group
of words carries out a different function.

Phrases and clauses are groups of words that work as nouns, verbs, adjectives,
adverbs or prepositions in sentences.

You can build layers of meaning by combining different types of words, phrases
and clauses. Layering sentences makes them more complex.

<example> 
 

* The plane arrived.
* The plane arrived in Darwin.
* The plane arrived in Darwin carrying freight.
* The plane arrived in Darwin carrying freight that needs inspection.
* The plane arrived in Darwin carrying freight that needs inspection for dangerous goods.
* The plane arrived in Darwin carrying freight that – before being unloaded – needs inspection for dangerous goods.
</example>

Some common constructions used in bureaucratic writing are complex and
unnecessary. They add words but not meaning.

Instead of bureaucratic language, use [plain language words and
terms](/node/55).

For example, use a verb instead of the noun that relates to the verb. If you use
the noun instead, you have to change the verb into the noun and usually add
other words.

<example> 
 

Please apply. [‘Apply’ is the verb.]

</example>

#### Use fewer than 3 adjectives or nouns at a time

Phrases that combine more than 3 adjectives or nouns are difficult to
understand. Rephrase sentences to break up strings of adjectives or [noun
trains](/node/122##noun_trains_are_hard_to_understand).

You can often rephrase the string of adjectives or noun train as a
[clause](/node/143). Follow the rule to keep sentences short and their structure
simple.

<example> 
 

The goal is to analyse how we can reallocate human resources. The analysis will
inform our business plan.

</example>

#### Avoid using ‘if’ and ‘unless’ together

Don’t use words such as ‘if’ and ‘unless’ in the same sentence.

<example> 
 

From 1 October, your partner can sign forms on your behalf.

</example>

#### Use ‘other than’ carefully

When you use ‘other than’, make sure it’s clear which words are included in the
exception.

<example> 
 

A person who is younger than 60, other than a teacher ...

</example>

#### Avoid ‘such ... as’ and ‘being’

Don’t use the ‘such ... as’ form.

<example> 
 

Take appropriate steps.

</example>

Use ‘and’ instead of ‘being’ or ‘not being’.

<example> 
 

A person who is 70 or over and has a driving licence ...

</example>

## Voice and tone

Writing style is a result of voice and tone. Adjust your style to meet user
needs. It influences whether and how people engage with content.

### Adapt writing style with tone and voice

Writing style describes the way you express ideas in content. The tone and voice
you use influence the writing style for any type of content.

Tone is the way you express ideas. It includes the words you use, the way you
put them together and their level of formality.

<example> 
* By registering with us, you can access a range of member services online. [Standard tone]
* Online services are only available to members who have registered. [Formal tone]
</example>

Voice captures who is writing – a persona people understand when they engage
with the content. Voice can be objective and institutional or personal and
friendly.

<example> 
* Over the next 3 years, the department will bolster its investment in cyber security. [Institutional voice, standard tone]
* Our investment in workforce capability will create an ‘army of cyber experts’. [Personal voice, standard tone]
</example>

Adapt tone and voice to engage users, so the content can meet their needs. For
example, briefs for ministers will use a different tone and voice to a speech or
information on a website.

### Align tone to context

Tone is created by 4 elements:

* choice of words
* viewpoint
* grammar
* level of formality.

#### Word choice

Word choice will influence how users respond to you and your organisation. The
smallest details, such as using contractions, can affect how content comes
across.

#### Viewpoint

The way the user relates to the content can depend on what pronouns feature in
sentence structure.

The second person (using the pronoun ‘you’) is active, direct and personal. It
can be more engaging for people reading and using government content.

Using the first person singular (the pronoun ‘I’) is rarely suitable in
government content, except in correspondence.

#### Grammar

Grammar is about [sentence structure](/node/120). It affects the way your
writing sounds and how easy it is to read.

#### Formality

Formality is about how closely you follow standard English and how familiar the
tone of content needs to be.

### Choose how formal tone should be

The appropriate level of formality depends on what the relationship is between
content and its user. There are 3 levels of formality:

* formal
* standard
* informal.

A formal tone creates a distance between the content’s persona and the content’s
reader.

An informal tone suggests a relationship that is more casual and intimate.

A standard tone sits between these 2. It is appropriate for most government
content. It creates little distance, but not too much familiarity, into the
relationship with readers.

<example> 
* Guests should be seated 15 minutes before the performance starts. [Formal]
* Why don’t you come in early and grab a seat before things get started? [Informal]
</example>

Standard style is the easiest for many people to understand.

<example> 
Please arrive 15 minutes before the concert starts. [Standard]

</example>

Formality does not affect [plain language](/node/55).

#### Formal tone

Formal tone:

* doesn’t use [contractions](/node/191)
* is literal – words are used with their dictionary meaning
* doesn’t use metaphor, slang or idioms
* often uses the third person (he, she, they, them).

Legal writing, policies, reports and ministerial letters often adopt a formal
tone. You can also use it in emails and letters when you have not yet met the
person you are writing to.

Formal tone is used in ceremonies and to show respect for someone in authority.

#### Standard tone

Standard tone combines formal and informal tone. Most people find standard tone
easiest to understand.

Standard tone:

* can use contractions and [personal pronouns](/node/131##there_are_different_kinds_of_pronouns)
* doesn’t use metaphors, idioms or slang.

You will probably use standard tone for most government content. This includes:

* emails and letters
* online government services
* corporate communications
* media releases
* articles.

#### Informal tone

Informal tone uses contractions and personal pronouns.

Informal tone can use metaphors and idioms, which can have a negative [effect on
inclusion](/node/178). Metaphors and idioms are not plain language.

You should not use slang when writing on behalf of government.

Informal tone is often used in [social media](/node/43) and [blogs](/node/44).
Your writing might also become more informal as you get to know the people you
are writing to.

### Identify the right voice

Voice is sometimes called a persona. It refers to the personality implicit in
the content.

Voice can be objective, formal and institutional, or it can be personal and
friendly. The right voice for content will depend on the persona fit for the
content.

Voice and the elements of tone are closely connected. Voice can create a tone of
equality (a relationship between equals) or one that assumes authority (power
is unequal).

A voice, or persona, can be:

* supportive, friendly, positive and empowering
* expert, impartial and balanced
* serious and authoritative, but reasonable, legitimate and measured.

Check your organisation’s style guide to see if it has advice about the
organisation’s voice.

If not, a safe place to start is with a basic government voice. It is the voice
of a ‘definitive source’ and is:

* respectful
* clear and direct
* objective and impartial.

A respectful writing style:

* uses [inclusive language](/node/178)
* expresses ideas in everyday words
* ‘speaks’ to people – using the pronoun ‘you’, for example
* doesn’t use inflammatory language, such as name-calling or sarcasm
* doesn’t speak down to people, but isn’t too familiar either.

A clear and direct writing style:

* is in [plain language](/node/55)
* uses [active voice](/node/204)
* is concise
* structures ideas
* makes it easy for people to understand what they need to know or do.

<example> 
We will not be funding any new projects this year.

</example>

Objective and impartial writing:

* relies on facts
* doesn’t include opinion
* is balanced and non-biased.

The difference between fact and opinion can be subtle.

Viewpoint affects perception of whether information is neutral or impartial.
Adjectives and adverbs can also affect whether the information comes across as
fact or opinion.

<example> 
There was 15 mm of rain last summer. This made it the driest summer for 120
years.

[The viewpoint is impersonal. The timescale of 120 years gives an objective
benchmark for the fact.]

</example>

## Editing and proofreading

Editing and proofreading help ensure consistency so content meets user needs and
expectations.

### Editing is integral to clear content

Editing is part of the work of any team that creates and publishes
content. Editing helps content meet user and business needs by ensuring it is:

* appropriate for the audience
* easily understood
* free from errors, consistent and complete.

#### Digital Service Standard requirements

You must make sure content is clear, accurate and consistent to meet the Digital
Service Standard:

* [Criterion 6. Consistent and responsive design](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/6-consistent-and-responsive-design)
* [Criterion 9. Make it accessible](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/9-make-it-accessible)

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can understand any information contained in an image.
* I can access equivalent information to anything contained in a video or audio file.
* I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.
* I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
* I can avoid making any mistakes with my inputs, and correct any that I might make.

Fundamentals:

* You must make sure content is consistent, has a clear structure and is error free to make it accessible for all users.
* Make sure content uses plain language. This helps all users and is essential for some. Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases and idioms. Expand all acronyms on their first use.
* Make sure other content elements, including captions, transcripts, alt text, link text, headings and instructions are accessible to all users.

### Types of editing (levels)

There are different levels of editing. Each involves specific tasks that happen
at certain stages in content development. The aim in any level of edit is to
meet user needs and make sure content is fit for purpose.

#### Substantive editing focuses on content, style, structure and meaning

The substantive edit reviews structural and textual elements when the draft
content is complete.

Substantive editing shapes text to make meaning clear. It also improves the
structure, usability, language and presentation of thecontent. It is sometimes
called a structural edit.

Before starting, agree on the scope of the substantive edit in the team.

The substantive edit can:

* conduct a plain English review to check sentence length, replace complex words with simpler alternatives and remove jargon
* check the design of the content to make sure it is the best possible format
* reorganise content to improve the flow of information and navigation
* identify gaps in the content or any information that can be removed
* reword content to make it easier to understand and to achieve consistent voice and tone
* check compliance with specific government requirements.

The style sheet is updated through a substantive edit to record any decisions
that can inform a copyedit.

##### Substantive editing is not rewriting or fact-checking

Substantive editing does not:

* write a significant amount of new content (but it can include advice to add more content)
* substantially rewrite to shorten text (but it can involve advice to delete content)
* choose the right typeface or apply formatting styles (but can include checking bolded, italicised and underlined font)
* fact-check, such as checking names of people and places, dates, citations, quotes or links to external content.

An editor can rewrite or fact-check content, but these are separate tasks to
substantive editing. They should happen before any editing begins.

#### Copyediting focuses on consistency and accuracy

Copyediting happens once the content is settled, for example, after the
substantive edit. A copyedit shows whether content is consistent, accurate and
complete.

Before starting, agree on the scope of the copyedit within the team. An editor
might identify substantive issues with the content during the copyedit. The team
should decide how it will address those issues.

If there is any more substantive editing or rewriting after the copyedit, the
content will need to be copyedited again.

During copyediting, an editor:

* corrects issues with language in line with the style sheet
* aligns the style of references and citations with agreed referencing style
* comments on inconsistencies in voice and tone.

A copyedit also checks for issues or inconsistencies with:

* design, layout and function
* illustrations, tables, headings, sequences, internal links and other elements.

The style sheet is updated during a copyedit to record style decisions.

##### Copyediting is not substantive editing or rewriting

Copyediting does not:

* restructure content (other than to make sentences clear and grammatically correct)
* write new content or shorten text
* rewrite text to unify voice or edit for plain English (other than to deal with isolated issues)
* format or design text
* fact-check
* check external links embedded in the content (other than a spot check in case there are systemic issues).

#### Proofreading is about quality control

Proofreading is a quality-assurance process. It happens after the copyedit. It
is a final check on visual and textual elements.

A proofread confirms that the content:

* is correct
* is complete
* meets the organisation’s requirements to publish.

Proofreading gives assurance:

* the content is ready to ‘go live’
* the printing press can start running.

Proofreading compares the content that is about to go live or to print with a
master copy. The master copy is the current copy of the approved text.

The master copy should be error-free so the proofreader can check for any
introduced errors.

A proofread compares the master copy with:

* the publishing platform
* the design proof from the designer
* a printer’s proof from the printer.

The proofread makes sure nothing gets changed or missed in any of these steps.

The style sheet is a critical tool for this task, even though proofreading is
not editing. (What many people call ‘proofreading’ is what editors call
‘copyediting’.) The style sheet ensures proofreaders’ work follows earlier style
decisions.

Proofreaders do not make changes to content. Proofreaders query issues such as:

* content that is different to the master copy, including changes, introduced errors and missing content
* missing or incorrectly placed elements such as links, page numbers, table headings and captions
* design elements like typefaces, heading styles and hierarchies, page breaks and spacing
* obvious errors in spelling or grammar, checked against the style sheet
* anything that goes against the decisions in the style sheet.

The proofreader’s queries go to whoever is responsible for resolving particular
issues.

There can be several rounds of proofreading until no errors remain. Each time
proofing corrections are made, the proofreader should check the content again.
Each check ensures there are no flow-on errors to the text, layout or design.

‘Blind proofreading’ is when there is no master copy. This requires an
experienced proofreader, because there is no authorised version to compare
against.

##### Proofreading is not editing

Proofreading is not editing and it is not a substitute for copyediting.

Proofreading does not include checking:

* for inconsistent language, spelling or grammar
* non-textual elements, such as the content of tables or illustrations.

Proofreaders notice issues and query them. Proofreading is not a chance to have
another round of editing, add more content, or add new functions to content.

##### Proofreading is better with 2 people

Proofreaders are most effective when working in teams of 2. The team is:

* a copyholder, who reads aloud from the master copy
* a reader, who checks the final version for changes and errors and marks up the content.

This approach is especially helpful when checking complex, data-rich content,
such as:

* mathematical or scientific content
* annual reports
* long financial tables.

### A style sheet is a useful tool

The style sheet is a living record and a tool for communicating decisions in the
content team. It helps to ensure quality and consistency.

A style sheet includes decisions about:

* the dictionary you follow
* any spelling variations
* any variations you are making from this manual or your organisation’s style guide.

It can also include any style decisions informed by user research on user needs
and accessibility.

An editor adds to the style sheet as they edit, including elements such as:

* spelling
* capitalisation
* grammar
* punctuation.

The updates ensure the style sheet records all decisions. Updates remove the
need to repeat the decision-making process on any aspect of the content.

Keeping a style sheet up to date means all team members can use the same style,
making the content as consistent as possible.

### Australian standards set out specialist skills and know-how

The Institute of Professional Editors (IPEd), in consultation with all
Australian editing societies, has developed the
[IPEd](https://www.iped-editors.org/about-editing/australian-standards/)[standards
for editing
practice](https://www.iped-editors.org/about-editing/australian-standards/).
This resource sets out the core standards that professional editors should meet.
It is the foundation for IPEd’s national [accreditation
scheme](https://www.iped-editors.org/accreditation-scheme/).

## How people find information

Design content based on the ways users find information.

### Learn how users search for information

Do user research so you can work out how content will:

* be found using different search strategies
* answer the questions users ask
* present the way users think it will
* use everyday language – many search queries are voice search.

Include the main words and phrases that people search for. This is part of
[search engine optimisation (SEO)](/node/103).

#### People use different strategies

Finding useful information online takes time and effort. People use different
ways to:

* look for information
* browse through search results or content
* assess the search results and content.

As people search for information, they often change what they’re looking for.

The way people look for information also changes with context. It can depend on
someone’s emotional state, their environment and what they are looking for. But
some people always use the same strategies to find content.

People go straight to information if they:

* know about the topic
* trust the source
* have used the source before
* know about the source because other people recommended it
* have already found similar information in that source
* have found the same content before.

##### Digital Service Standard requirements

You must understand the needs of all users of your service and create content
they can access to meet the Digital Service Standard:

* [Criterion 1. Understand user
  needs](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/1-understand-user-needs)
* [Criterion 9. Make it
  accessible](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/9-make-it-accessible).

#### Finding information requires a range of skills

A successful search for information requires these skills:

* operational skills – entering a URL in the right place, or putting the keywords in a search engine
* formal skills – navigating across different websites without getting lost
* information skills – choosing the right information that will help the user
* strategic skills – choosing the right words to find the right content.

#### People may use navigation, site search or both

People use government websites to complete a task or find information. They will
browse using navigation tools (menus and links), or use the site’s search
function. They might also do both.

##### Navigation

When browsing, it is easier for people to recognise a familiar term than it is
for them to remember the right keyword for a search. For this reason, some
people prefer to navigate using menus and links.

Others need to browse to discover new sources of information.

Some people won’t browse because site search is more effective for them.

##### Site search

People tend to use site search:

* as a fallback when they can’t find what they want using navigation tools
* if they are looking for a particular document or product.

To help people who prefer to find information through site search, remember:

* Complex websites need site search for finding content.
* On very large websites, site search is often the best way to find pages that contain specific phrases or keywords. These pages hold content that navigation tools might not discover.
* People may also use the site search function on the search engine results page, if the site is configured to show this.

### Familiar page structures are easier to search

Familiar structures work best because people understand and expect them. The
effort goes into scanning and reading, rather than searching through content.
Use the guidance on content [structure](/node/192).

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
* I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.
* I can predict the webpage's appearance and how I will operate the content.

Fundamentals:

* Write clear page titles. This is the first thing to appear in search results and the first words heard by screen reader users.
* Organise content in a clear order using section headings. Make sure all users can navigate through all content in the intended order, regardless of the technology they are using.
* Use the same navigation elements consistently across services. Make sure the user can understand where they are within the website or service.
* Write link text that makes the destination and purpose of the link clear.
* Write clear and concise headings to help users find the information they're looking for.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [2.4.2 Page titled – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##page-titled)
* [2.4.5 Multiple ways – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=315##multiple-ways)
* [2.4.6 Headings and labels – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=246##headings-and-labels)
* [2.4.10 Section headings – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##section-headings)
* [1.3.2 Meaningful sequence – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##meaningful-sequence)
* [2.4.8 Location – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=248##location)
* [2.4.3 Focus order – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##focus-order)
* [3.2.3 Consistent navigation – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##consistent-navigation)
* [2.4.4 Link purpose (in context) – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##link-purpose-in-context)
* [2.4.9 Link purpose (link only) – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##link-purpose-link-only)

## Keywords and search engines

Keywords reflect core ideas and topics in content. Choosing the right keywords
will support people’s ability to find the content they need when they search for
it online.

### Match keywords to the search terms people use

Using keywords helps people find content that meets their search
intention. Keywords help people:

* find government services – for example, ‘myGov login’
* discover information – for example, ‘can I get paid maternity leave?’
* define a task – for example, ‘import wine to Australia’.

Government content should help users find information and achieve what they need
to do.

To write for users and search engines, you need to understand:

* what users need to do with government
* the keywords they’re likely to use.

Use this information to design content for people and search engines. You can
combine it with other techniques for [on-page optimisation](/node/71).

<example> 
A website helps users become Australian citizens.

You have researched with users who are keen to become Australian citizens. You
have found they use the keyword ‘citizen’ a lot.

Include ‘citizen’ in the content, title, meta description and web address (URL).

</example>

#### Digital Service Standard requirements

You must help the users of your service to find the information they need to
meet the [Digital Service
Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria).

#### Accessibility requirements

User need:

I can read and understand text, even if there are unusual words and shortened
forms, or languages other than English.

Fundamentals:

Write in plain English. This helps all users and is essential for some.

Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases, idioms and so on. Expand all acronyms
on their first use.

Use keywords that users expect to see and are looking for, so they are indexed
by search engines.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [3.1.3 Unusual words – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##unusual-words)
* [3.1.4 Abbreviations – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##abbreviations)
* [3.1.5 Reading level – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##reading-level)

### Write keyword-based content

To write content that users and search engines will discover:

* Find out which keywords to use through a keyword tool, analytics and [user research](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/build-and-improve-services/user-research).
* Write content using keywords and descriptive [plain language](/node/55).
* [Structure content](/node/192) (including forms and online tools) so people find what they need.

Include keywords once or twice, if they make sense, in the first paragraph of
the content. You can also include them in this way in the final paragraph.

Include terms and concepts that are closely related to the topic you are writing
about. This helps search engines understand the theme of the page.

Don’t use too many keywords or keywords that are outside the context of the
content. This is known as keyword stuffing. Search engines ban or penalise this
type of content.

Some information could relate to a specific place or a group of people. Make
sure you include these details (for example, ‘student placements in northern
NSW’).

<example> 
You are writing content to help users find Australian embassies in Europe.

User research shows that when people search for an Australian embassy they’re
either:

* preparing to travel
* needing help with an emergency situation.

The types of keywords you might use are:

* embassy locations
* emergency terms and current dangers
* modes of travel
* passport and visa terms.
</example>

People must be able to discover information produced by Australian Government
agencies.

To assist agencies, the National Archives of Australia (NAA) has published
advice on [describing
information](https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/describing-information).
The NAA advice includes information about [metadata for web
content](https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/describing-information/metadata/metadata-web##standards).

## On-page optimisation

Make content easy for people to find using search engines. Include keywords in
URLs, metadata and content. Create accessible links to high-quality content.

### Optimise content for users first

Help people find the content they need using optimisation techniques.

On-page optimisation includes using keywords, metadata and links in the page
content. Website analytics tools can also help you optimise pages for [search
engines](/node/70).

Focus on making the page for users first, and for search engines second.

<example> 
You’re writing content to help users claim family tax benefits.

User research shows users look for ‘child care’, ‘income’ and ‘payments’ when
they need help with family tax benefits.

Write content that includes these terms and topics, and that answers the
questions people are most likely to ask.

</example>

#### Digital Service Standard requirements

You must help the users of your service to find the information they need to
meet the [Digital Service
Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria).

### Use keywords in the URL and content

Use keywords in the:

* web address (URL, or ‘uniform resource locator’)
* metadata
* [headings](/node/51)
* [page content](/node/72)
* [internal links](/node/193)
* [captions and alt text for images](/node/49).

Create URLs that contain words from the title of the page with the main keywords
close to the start.

The URL should be below 100 characters and make sense to the user.

To separate words in the URL, use hyphens instead of spaces or underscores. This
helps both people and search engines understand each word.

<example> 
[https://stylemanual.gov.au/about-style-manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/about-style-manual)

</example>

### Write metadata that explains the page

Metadata is information about a webpage that search engines use. It also has
other information, such as the date when the webpage was published. Metadata
sits in the code in the background of a webpage.

Two important parts of metadata display in search results:

* the page title
* the meta description.

Write these parts so that users can tell whether the page holds what they’re
looking for.

#### Title

The title tells users and search engines what a page is about.

The title should:

* include keywords
* be different on each page
* be shorter than 70 characters.

Titles that are too long will get cut off by search engines.

In a search result, the title is usually the first line. It works as a headline
in the search results.

<example> 
         A title snippet (highlighted) for a Digital Transformation Agency page  </example>

##### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.

Fundamentals:

* Write clear page titles. This is the first thing a screen reader user will hear and needs to assure them they are on the right page.
* Ensure the linking text to this page relates to the title.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criterion:

[2.4.2 Page Titled Level
A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=242##page-titled)

#### Meta description

The <meta name="description"> field gives search engines a summary of the page’s
content. Search engines often use the description in the search result listing.

Describe the content in [plain language](/node/194). This helps users to know if
it’s what they need.

Descriptions need to be user-focused and contain keywords. They can be up to 160
characters.

Search engines might also use a snippet of text from the content instead of a
meta description.

<example> 
         A meta description snippet for a Digital Transformation Agency page  </example>

### Create useful links to high-quality content

Linking is the basis of the internet. The quality of the pages you link to
affects the ranking of your site.

Links can be:

* internal, which take users to pages within the same website
* external, which take users to pages on other websites.

Use relevant keywords as the anchor text (for example, don’t use ‘click here’ as
link text).

Link to content on other quality sites towards the end of the content.

<example> 
Make sure users can read content on all devices using [responsive design
methods](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/6-consistent-and-responsive-design).

[The text ‘responsive design methods’ links to a page about consistent and
responsive design.]

</example>

#### Accessibility requirements

User need:

I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.

Fundamentals:

Write link text that makes the destination and purpose of the link clear.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [2.4.4 Link purpose (in context) – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##link-purpose-in-context)
* [2.4.9 Link purpose (link only) – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##link-purpose-link-only)

### Use analytics as part of user research

Analytics are a convenient source for near-real-time information about users.
They can help you identify the language people use and give you hints about what
they need.

Don’t rely on analytics alone. Use analytics as part of [research with
users](/node/76).

Analytics that can support your research include:

* keywords and phrases users are searching with
* landing pages, site journeys and exit pages
* the number of first-time and return visitors
* the length of time users stay on a page
* the volume of traffic and where it’s coming from
* most and least popular pages.

Be careful of using common metrics (like number of unique visits and time on
page) as a measure of success. A page might meet a user’s need after a
very quick visit.

The National Archives of Australia publishes advice for Australian Government
employees working in information management. This advice includes information
about [metadata for web
content](https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/describing-information/metadata/metadata-web).

## Understanding search engines

Metadata, keywords and page structure are important. Write and design content so
users can easily find it with search engines and voice search.

### Search engines help users find content

Search engines:

* index websites (using algorithms)
* search the index
* organise the results.

Examples include Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo.

Search engines use a process called indexing to look for content. Algorithms
(automated procedural instructions) do the indexing.

To index the content, algorithms use [keywords in titles and
metadata](/node/72). The HTML <title> element is the heading that most search
engines display in search results.

Algorithms change. Monitor how content is performing in search results and
update it so you are always using the right keywords.

#### Digital Service Standard requirements

You must understand the tools and systems used to build the service, and you
must test the service from end to end to meet the Digital Service Standard:

* [Criterion 4. Understand tools and systems](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/4-understand-tools-and-systems)
* [Criterion 10. Test the service](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/10-test-service).

### Plain language and helpful keywords improve search

Most searches are short. More than 65% of search queries have three words or
fewer. To find out what words or terms people use, do [user research](/node/76).

In general, to help people find content:

* Use [plain language](/node/55).
* Include [headings](/node/51).
* Embed keywords in the [metadata and content](/node/71).

For example, some departments use reference numbers instead of titles for some
of their forms. Without a title, algorithms can’t find the forms easily. It also
makes search harder for users if they don’t know the exact reference number for
the form they’re looking for.

If you include a reference number, place it after the form’s title so the
algorithm can find the [form](/node/177).

<example> 
To find a government form a user’s question might be, ‘What form do I need to
fill out so I can transfer ownership of my car?’

What the user searches: ‘forms for selling a car’

Best search result: ‘Transfer your car to a new owner (Form 1066)’

</example>

#### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

* I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
* I can read and understand text, even if there are unusual words and shortened forms, or languages other than English.

Fundamentals:

* Ensure that the words people expect to see and are looking for are indexed by search engines.
* Write in plain language. This helps all users and is essential for some.
* Level AAA requires a lower secondary education reading level, after removal of proper names and titles (year 7 or between 12 and 14 years old).
* Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases, idioms and so on. Expand all acronyms on their first use.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

* [2.4.2 Page titled – level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##page-titled)
* [3.1.5 Reading level – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##reading-level)
* [3.1.3 Unusual words – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##unusual-words)
* [3.1.4 Abbreviations – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/##abbreviations)

### Structure of pages affects search

Use the best structure for the type of content you need. In government content:

* To put the most important content at the top of the page, use the [inverted pyramid](/node/77).
* To lead people through a series of steps, use [sequential structure](/node/78).

Include keywords that users relate to the topic in
[headings](/node/51##use_keywords_to_start_headings) and final
[paragraphs](/node/53). Algorithms look at these structural elements to assess
and rank webpages.

### Voice search may be longer and more complex

Voice search is when people use the voice functions on their mobile and smart
home devices to find information online.

When people use voice search, they tend to use full questions and more informal
language. They don’t use single words or short phrases as they would when they
type a search term.

People using voice search will be able to find the content more easily if you:

* avoid words that sound similar to other words (homophones) – for example, a voice search could confuse the words ‘hear’ and ‘here’
* create direct content that answers users’ questions.

People sometimes don’t use their usual search engine when they use voice search.
Design content for more than one search engine to help people find what they
need.

## Security classifications and protective markings

Use protective markings for government information. Follow your organisation’s
procedures to add them.

### Add protective markings to government information

If you are working with government information, follow organisational procedures
to assess and apply protective markings to sensitive and classified information.

The protective marking will usually be in all capitals at the top and bottom of
a page.

Information is assessed and given protective marking to identify if it is
sensitive or security classified.

* Information might be identified as ‘Unofficial’, ‘Official’ or ‘Official: Sensitive’.
* Information might be security classified as ‘Protected’, ‘Secret’ or ‘Top Secret’.
* Other protective markings include caveats (such as codewords and special handling instructions) and information management markers. Caveat markings are mandatory and information management markers are optional.

All sensitive and security classified information, including emails, carry
protective markings. Information metadata is also marked.

Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) requirements include how the
information is classified and marked, and what this means for its storage,
handling, access and disposal. For more information, [consult the PSPF
webpages](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/). Or consult your
organisation’s protective security policy.

#### Security classification requirements

The Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) explains how protective markings
should be formatted. To achieve clearly identifiable protective markings, the
PSPF recommends:

* using capitals, bold text, large font and a distinctive colour (red preferred)
* placing markings at the centre top and bottom of each page
* separating markings by a double forward slash to help clearly differentiate each marking.

When you write for the Australian Government, be aware of [PSPF requirements for
government
information](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/pspf-annual-release). Follow
organisational procedures to apply security classifications and protective
markings to content before referring to the PSPF.

Agency implementation of the PSPF is supported by the [Department of Home
Affairs](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/).

### Use initial capitals to write about protective markings

In general content, use an initial capital unless you are reporting how the
protective marking actually appears on the page. In that instance, write the
marking as it appears and use quotation marks.

<example>
Only those with an existing Negative Vetting 1 security clearance are considered
for supervised temporary access to Top Secret information.

The field report was stamped ‘TOP SECRET’.</example>

## User research and content

Only create content that meets a need. Find out about users and their needs
through user research.

### Create content that meets a real need

Only design and write content that meets a real person’s need.

People using government services usually don’t have a choice to go somewhere
else to meet their need. They don’t read government content for fun. They are
using it to get something done.

Find out about users and their needs through [user
research](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/build-and-improve-services/user-research).

User research helps you:

* understand the user, their needs, behaviours and motivations
* work out the problems you are trying to solve with content
* reduce the risk of creating content that is not useful or usable
* have more certainty about what to write.

#### Digital Service Standard requirements

You must understand the needs of the users of your service to meet the Digital
Service Standard: [Criterion 1. Understand user
needs](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/1-understand-user-needs).

### Write for the user, not ‘an audience’

Writing for an audience is not the same as writing for the user.

The content we write might have more than one user with a range of different
needs.

It’s not enough to imagine one kind of user. You need to do user research to
learn about the range of users and their contexts. It's important to find out
about their specific and diverse needs.

A user’s needs and context may include:

* a primary language that is something other than English
* assistive technology they use to read the content
* a range of devices they use to access the content with
* the availability and speed of their internet access
* a need for a paper or non-digital way to access content.

#### Accessibility considerations

Do user research to help you to understand how to meet the needs of all users.

Include people with disability in your user research to avoid creating any
barriers for them.

### Adjust the research approach to the context

The way you research changes based on the kind of work you are doing and its
context.

If you can, work with a user researcher to plan the approach.

#### Policy or project work

In a policy or project context, you may be writing material that is only
intended for an internal use. Only a few people might read it.

In this context you may not need to do research with the people who will read
the content. You might need to find out about the subject of the content you are
working on.

If you are writing about other people, make sure you are not making assumptions
about them. This includes other people working in government as well as end
users.

<example> 
You are a policy officer working on a short progress report for a senior
manager. The report updates the manager on a government policy your team is
developing.

As you write the report you check for assumptions about the people the policy
will affect. You identify some untested assumptions so you raise this with
the team for more research.

</example>

#### Service design and delivery

User research is critical to the service design and delivery process. In this
process, everyone in the team takes part in research through the Discovery,
Alpha, Beta and Live stages.

From Discovery and into Alpha stage, the research is generative. It’s about
gaining insights about users, contexts and needs – usually through face-to-face
interviews.

When the team moves into Beta, the research becomes evaluative. It’s about
testing that the content and the design is meeting the user’s needs.

Read the DTA’s digital guides to find out about the [role of user research in
service
design](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/build-and-improve-services/user-research).

<example> 
You are a content designer working on a government service. Your team follows
the service design and delivery process.

* Discovery stage: you observe research sessions with users and help to analyse them. The user researcher plans and leads the sessions to help the team learn about the users and their needs.
* Alpha stage: you help the team experiment with different content formats. You join research sessions to see if the prototypes help meet the user needs.
* Beta stage: you work with the team to design content for the whole service. You observe people in usability sessions interact with the content you have designed. After analysing the research as a team, you improve the content.
* Live stage: you and the team spend time each sprint reviewing user feedback and analytics. If there are areas that need more exploration, the researcher plans targeted research.
</example>

#### Communication and website teams

Teams that work on content owned by other areas of the organisation use research
in different ways.

In some cases, the communications or web team may be able to lead the work and
follow the service design and delivery process. In other cases, they may
organise user research to support the business area.

<example> 
You are a writer and editor working in a corporate communications team. Your
team supports several business areas that own most of the content on the
website.

The team’s approach to research changes based on where content is in a [content
lifecycle](https://www.digitalprofession.gov.au/content-strategy-guide/manage-content-requests):

* Intent: as a team you audit website content to identify what is and is not used.
* Plan: you join members of another team in watching user research sessions. The team observes users interacting with their content, to identify pain points. People from both teams take part in a session to analyse the research.
* Create, check and revise: you observe readability tests of your content with end users. You edit the content in response to the user experience.
* Maintain: you watch usability testing of content on your agency’s website. You observe users having trouble understanding a form. Following the session, you work with the business area that owns the form to improve it.
* Remove: you help review analytics and user feedback to flag pages that have low traffic. You provide a report to the business area to recommend removing the pages.
</example>

### User research is a team sport

If you are creating content you need to be part of the user research process.

It is best if you can observe research sessions led by an experienced user
researcher. Then help to synthesise and analyse the research.

In a team that is delivering a service, everyone is part of research for at
least 2 hours every 6 weeks. This include writers, content designers and
editors.

People who work on content must be part of the discovery process. They need to
observe research sessions and contribute their perspective in analysis. Content
designers, writers and editors notice things that other people may miss. They
provide a critical content lens on the work.

### Some research is better than none

User research is a craft. If possible, get an expert to lead research. This will
help you uncover as much as possible and manage bias.

If you or your team are not able to access a user researcher or to talk to
users, at least do desktop research.

#### Desktop research

Desktop research includes looking at website analytics to identify search
keywords and topics. It also involves exploring forums and social media to find
out the questions people are asking and the words they use.

When you look at search data be aware that people use different words to search
for and to talk about things. Search terms can also be different based on the
forum and site they are using.

Desktop research will not provide the same quality of insight as you get from
talking to users. It is better to do this than no research at all.

It’s also helpful to do desktop research as well as interviewing users.

#### Previous research

Review existing relevant research as part of your desktop research. This
includes research by other teams and academic research from outside government.

When you review existing research, be aware that the context will be different.
There may also be gaps in the research.

Use existing research as a starting point. It’s not helpful to research the same
thing over and over.

### Market research is different from user research

User research helps you understand users, their needs and the context for
services.

Market research and stakeholder engagement are different types of research. They
cannot give you the same insights you get from user research.

If you have a choice, do user research. It can be helpful to do market research
and stakeholder management as well.

#### User research: know the user

User research:

* uses qualitative research (feedback) and quantitative research (statistics)
* focuses on the ‘why’ (including people’s underlying needs, motivations and the goals they are trying to achieve) and the 'what’ (what people actually do), as well as the usability of what is being designed
* provides deep insights into user needs and behaviour
* uses small-scale and often iterative techniques (for example, interviews, feedback, usability testing, sample-size testing, field studies and workshops)
* aims to understand user needs and fix usability problems
* helps to design content and services that are accessible and usable for all users

#### Market research: know the market

Market research:

* uses quantitative research (statistics)
* focuses on the ‘what’
* provides broad information
* uses wide-scale techniques (for example, focus groups, randomised control trials, surveys, analytics, and website split testing)
* aims to understand market preferences and how to reach that market
* helps to measure characteristics across the population to build market share in a particular segment

#### Stakeholder engagement: know the community

Stakeholder engagement:

* focuses on the ‘who’ and the ‘how’
* provides insights that support issues management
* uses techniques that are contextualised to the scale and complexity of the issues
* aims to manage the influence of people and groups
* helps the design of processes to deliver an outcome
